Wizkid earlier today gave a shoutout to producer, Killertunez hailing him for the work he has put into his forthcoming Album “Made In Lagos” and neglecting Northboi who also has worked on the album and infact produced Wizkid’s recent single; “Joro.” Wizkid wrote; “Killatunes a great man!! Love you my bro. Appreciate you for everything ! Y’all follow @Killertunes_Tii and show him love for everything! Man finished my album!” Killatunes a great man!! Love you my bro. Appreciate you for everything ! Y’all follow @Killertunes_Tii and show him love for everything! Man finished my album! ?????? — Wizkid (@wizkidayo) October 5, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js It seems Northboi got angry by Wizkid’s act, especially for refusing to give him credit thereby went ahead on Twitter to call out Wizkid. Northboi reveals if not for him, Wizkid wouldn’t have had a major hit since “Ojuelegba” and “Don’t Dull.” He also criticized him for failing to promote him as he feels Wizkid is scared he might be more recignized than him as the biggest contributor to the song. He wrote; “Imagine being so powerful person wey you do beat for dey fear to promote you make you no pass am. Na my hand you collect your last global hit. After me all you have is ojuelegba and dont dull.” imagine being so powerful person wey you do beat for dey fear to promote you make you no pass am. Na my hand you collect your last global hit. after me all you have is ojuelegba and dont dull. — NorthBoitheOracle (@NorthboiBeats) October 5, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Could this drama be real or an ordinary publicity stunt?
