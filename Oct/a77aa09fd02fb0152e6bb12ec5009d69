 For our #BellaNaijaMCM feature this week, we celebrate Lubem Shadrach Mtile who is leading developmental initiatives in north eastern Nigeria, ravaged by insurgency. Lubem is the co-founder/program coordinator of Mentor Africa Development Initiative (MADI), a local non-governmental organization in Yola, the capital of Nigeria’s north-eastern state – Adamawa. The NGO’s focus is on using technology to provide out of school children and public schools with free access to quality education and resources. In Nigeria, there are well over 10 million out of school children, with the majority of that number being from northern Nigeria. Also, a large percent of that number are girls and Lubem has taken it upon himself to connect them to opportunities through education. Through his Northern Girls Code initiative, Lubem provides access to the internet and beginners education in coding and software engineering for out-0f-school girls. The initiative has trained 36 girls and 40 young adult women, 5 of whom are internally displaced. Lubem engages the children, victims of the Boko Haram insurgency, in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps through ‘Chess Mistress’ – a chess, scrabble and movie screening event that has engaged over 86 children. Lubem holds a bachelors degree from Benue State University and a masters degree in Peace Studies & Conflict Resolution from Modibbo Adama University of Technology. He was a Prize for Education nominee in The Future Awards Africa (TFAA) 2018. We celebrate Lubem for empowering girls and other children in disadvantaged communities to compete favourably with their counterparts.
