Victor Osimhen joined Lille this past summer from Belgium outfit RSC Charleroi. Lille are believed to have paid around £10.8m for Osimhen’s services. In his short stint in France Osimhen has been in fine form. The 20-year-old has played 12 games across all competitions for the Ligue 1 outfit. In those 12 games, Osimhen has scored eight and assisted two. One of those goals would come against Chelsea in the Champions League. Now, the Newcastle Chronicle are reporting that Newcastle’s scouts are keeping tabs on the Lille attacker. The Chronicle also gave an update on Newcastle’s potential January plans: Bruce will have money available to spend in January but is not putting too much emphasis on the winter window and may only look to make one or two tweaks at the start of 2020.

Newcastle’s latest outing saw them taking on Chelsea. The Magpies have picked up just two victories in the Premier League this season vs Tottenham and Manchester United. But despite their previous joy against the bigger clubs, the North East outfit couldn’t find a way through Frank Lampard’s side on Saturday. Marcos Alonso would put Chelsea 1-0 up in the 73rd minute and that is how proceedings would end. That defeat means Newcastle will end week nine of the 2019/20 PL season in the relegation zone.
