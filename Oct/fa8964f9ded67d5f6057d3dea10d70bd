As per a report from journalist Duncan Castles, Manchester United could swoop for Lyon star Moussa Dembele in January, with the player interested in a move to Old Trafford. 23-year-old hitman Dembele made a return to his home country last summer, when the Frenchman joined Lyon from Celtic for €22 million. And, on the back of an impressive stint with the Scottish champions, Dembele has since gone on to carry his goalscoring exploits back to Ligue 1. The powerful attacker’s debut season at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais saw him rack up 20 goals and 6 assists across all competitions.

And, as per the aforementioned report from Duncan Castles, one such outfit keen on Dembele are Premier League giants Manchester United. Speaking on the Transfer Window Podcast, Castles revealed that the Red Devils are weighing up a January swoop for the Lyon star. Significantly, it is also added that contact between United and the player’s entourage has been made: ‘I can tell you there has been contact between Manchester United and individuals close to Moussa Dembele to assess the player’s interest in the move and to work out what the cost would be in terms of salary.’ ‘And also, to get a feel for what it would take to get him out of Lyon.’ ‘Dembele has been identified by United as a player who could be a top level centre-forward down the line.’ Finally, Castles suggests that Dembele himself ‘would be receptive’ to a winter switch to Old Trafford: ‘The interest from Dembele’s side in moving to the Premier League is large. He sees that as a place he will play further down his career.’ ‘Were Manchester United to select Dembele as a target for the January window, he would be receptive to that move.’ ‘And, I believe, he would take the risk of moving in the January window.’ Man United loanee Alexis Sanchez picks up potentially-serious injury on international duty Man United’s wage bill highest ever reported by English top-flight side – Mirror Source: Great Goals Moussa Dembele has ruled out a move to Manchester United and insists he will stay at Lyon for another season.
