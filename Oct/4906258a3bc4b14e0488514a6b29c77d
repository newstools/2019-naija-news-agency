 Nigerian Gospel HipHop Artist, Nolly has dropped another hit single, “Answer Me” featuring Ghanaian rapper Esaias. Answer Me is a soulful mid tempo afrobeat tune and with Esaias popular for rapping in his native Twi language,  the result was a masterpiece, sincere worship. Nolly shares: “This song came to me as a victory song when I was facing a serious challenge in my life. It is a song of reassurance to all who call upon the name of the Lord that he surely answers us when we call.
He says “Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.”
– Jeremiah 33:3 NIV The song was produced by Stansteel and mixed and mastered by OkeySokay. STREAM/DOWNLOAD AUDIO
