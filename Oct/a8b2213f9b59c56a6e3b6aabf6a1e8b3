Burna Boy The most anticipated music award, The Headies, has finally come and although ended has left reactions in its trail… as usual. Unfortunately, the award coincided with another big event this year, Starboy Fest, which took place at the O2, London with top Nigerian music stars like Tiwa Savage, Naira Marley, Fireboy DML and many others performing at the Fest, hence couldn’t make it to one of the biggest music awards in Nigeria. Although absent, some of these stars like Burna Boy still got a big win at the Headies with three awards to his name while FalzTheBahdGuy took home three awards and Teni Entertainer winning the highest for the night with wins on Four award categories. Rema who seems to be the youngest in the category didn’t leave empty-handed as he won the Next Rated award category, defeating top talented acts such as Fireboy DML, Zlatan, Joeboy and Lyta.
