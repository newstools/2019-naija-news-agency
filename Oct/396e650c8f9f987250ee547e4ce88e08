Manchester United legend Gary Neville has revealed his opinion that Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold should not be considered as a world-class full-back, until he improves defensively. Liverpool welcomed Spurs to Anfield yesterday evening, for their latest Premier League outing. The Reds headed into proceedings looking to reestablish their comfortable 6-point advantage over champions Manchester City atop the English top-flight table, after the Citizens put Aston Villa to the sword by 3 goals to nil on Saturday. And, when the 90 minutes were said and done on Merseyside, stretch their lead over Pep Guardiola’s outfit once more was precisely what Liverpool managed. A hectic opening to proceedings actually saw Tottenham take the lead. After Heung-min Son’s effort from outside the area was deflected onto the upright by Dejan Lovren, Harry Kane was on hand to nod home on the rebound. Liverpool, however, showcased the spirit of champions-elect as proceedings wore on. First, Jordan Henderson levelled things up with a superb finish shortly after the interval, after being played in by midfield partner Fabinho. And Mohamed Salah then turned the clash on its head 15 minutes from time, lashing home from the penalty spot to secure all 3 points for the hosts. 10 – Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 10 Premier League games when conceding the first goal at Anfield (W7 D3), winning each of the last six.

Fabinho was, in the eyes of many, the standout performer at Anfield, with the Brazilian having patrolled the middle of the park in superb fashion throughout proceedings. Trent Alexander-Arnold, meanwhile, was another of the Reds’ key men versus Spurs. English stopper Alexander-Arnold created a hatful of chances with a number of sensational deliveries into the visitors’ box. The 21-year-old’s display, though, was far from flawless. TAA was also caught out defensively on a couple of occasions, with Heung-min Son having caused all sorts of problems down Liverpool’s right. And it was such defensive shortcomings which a legendary Premier League full-back was keen to highlight post-match. Speaking in the Sky Sports studio, Gary Neville revealed his opinion that, though Alexander-Arnold is already ‘one of the best attacking full-backs he has ever seen’, the Liverpool star simply cannot be considered as world-class, until he ‘sorts it out defensively’: ‘Liverpool’s full-back are quite simply sensational. Robertson is a better full-back than Trent Alexander Arnold.’ ‘I think Arnold is getting to a point where he is one of the best attacking full-backs I’ve ever seen but the three chances Tottenham had today, he also gave some free-kicks away, he has to be serious about his defence.’ ‘I took the Man of the Match off him. He can be a world-class full-back, if he sorts it out defensively.’ Quotes via the Daily Mail Roy Keane brands Tottenham duo ‘Dumb and Dumber’ after Liverpool defeat Sadio Mane reveals intention to remain at Liverpool ‘forever’ Source: Great Goals Liverpool have this evening provided updates on the fitness of a number of the club’s defenders, ahead of their meeting with Tottenham this weekend.
