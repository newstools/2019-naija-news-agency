Reports across England this evening suggest that David Moyes could replace Marco Silva on the Everton bench over the coming weeks, if results do not quickly improve under the latter. Despite having splashed out heavily on reinforcements to the club’s squad once again this past summer, Everton have endured a dismal start to the new season. As things stand, the Toffees sit in the Premier League relegation zone, having picked up just 7 points from their 8 league outings. This includes a run of 4 straight defeats in the English top-flight over the last month, the latest of which saw Everton put to the sword by a goal to nil at Burnley this past Saturday: As such, after failing to secure what was no doubt an expected European berth for his side during his debut campaign at Goodison Park last time out, Everton’s abysmal recent form has resulted in inevitable speculation surrounding the future of Marco Silva The latest bookmakers’ odds have the Portuguese tactician as the Premier League front-runner to be relieved of his duties, at just 8/11. This sees Silva sit ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Mauricio Pochettino, who are both available at odds of 7/2. And, according to the Daily Mail, the Mirror and more this evening, a surprise candidate is already being lined up as a potential replacement for Silva on Merseyside. The tactician in question is former Everton boss David Moyes. Moyes, who has been out of work since departing West Ham last year, previously oversaw proceedings at Goodison Park for 11 years, between 2002 and 2013. As per the latest update courtesy of betting syndicate Paddy Power this evening, though, a flurry of bets have seen the Scot’s odds of making a return to the Everton hotseat slashed from 7/4 to just 5/6. Moyes himself, meanwhile, is said to be keen on the Toffees job.
