My people!!! How una dey? It is with great joy and deep gratitude to God that I present you all the track list of our soon-to-drop album titled ZANKU. My journey has been a mixture of pain, laughter, disappointments, gains, sadness, peace and more. I have had low and high moments. In all of these though, God has been faithful. Without God, there would have been no Zlatan Ibile. It is my pleasure to share my life experience with y’all through our album. ZLATANOVAZ, I can’t thank you enough for your support.
