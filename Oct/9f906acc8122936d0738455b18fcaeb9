If Tottenham could have hand-picked an opponent for round 9 of the Premier League, they’d probably have picked Watford. Spurs have lost four of their last five matches in all competitions. That included a 7-2 home defeat to Bayern Munich, plus a 3-0 away loss at Brighton before the international break. Watford, meanwhile, are bottom of the league with only three points. The Hornets only have one win in their last six. As reported in the Evening Standard, Heung-min Son and Christian Eriksen are both injury doubts for the Watford game. Heung-min Son featured for South Korea in midweek away in an empty stadium in North Korea. On Son’s availability against Watford, readers are told: Heung-min Son is doubtful for Tottenham’s match against Watford on Saturday after playing in the “war-like” World Cup qualifier in North Korea on Tuesday. The South Korea forward was not expected back until Thursday, leaving him with just one day’s training before the visit of the Premier League’s bottom club. Eriksen is an injury doubt for Saturday’s match. The midfielder picked up a dead leg playing for Denmark in the international break.

Eriksen made it clear he wanted to leave Spurs last summer, but that didn’t happen. The Dane is in the final year of his Tottenham contract. Yet, Tøfting has rejected suggestions Eriksen should join Bayern Munich or Real Madrid: I have been following the player for a long time and so far he has disappointed me in 2019. A transfer to Bayern would not make any sense for me and would be very surprising. Christian is not the big superstar, he doesn’t have a big ego, he doesn’t want to be the center of attention, he’s not a (Paul) Pogba, he’s very introverted and down to earth. He lets his feet do the talking. Also see: Jurgen Klinsmann set to become Ecuador’s national coach.
