Bayern Munich’s Thomas Muller has admitted that he could leave the German giants if his current standing as a substitute player doesn’t change. Muller has been a great servant for Bayern during his time at the club. The German has scored a whopping 186 goals and assisted 171 in 495 appearances. He’s also been a pivotal player for the German national team in that time. Though, it’s not been great for him recently. Germany manager Joachim Löw decided not long ago that Muller would not be called up to the national team anymore. Now, he’s become somewhat of a substitute player at Bayern Munich. As a result, Muller has admitted he’s not happy with the situation.

Muller also claimed that if he’s only seen as a substitute, he’ll have to consider leaving because he’s ‘just too ambitious for that’. ‘I’m absolutely not (satisfied with the situation)’, he explained. ‘I am just 30 years old, fit and hungry for success – with the club, but also personally. I am firmly convinced that I can help the team on the pitch.’ ‘A coach has to make difficult decisions before each game. However, the trend in the past five games does not make me happy. ‘If the coaching team only sees me in the role of a substitute player in the future, I have to think about it. I’m just too ambitious for that.’   After a not quite optimal weekend for us it is the perfect weather to focus on the important things – training while it’s raining #stayfocused #comebackstronger #miasanmia #esmuellert #schlammschlacht#watnespiegelung A post shared by  Thomas Müller (@esmuellert) on Oct 9, 2019 at 2:58am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Liverpool’s name has been thrown into the hat regarding Thomas Muller in the past.
