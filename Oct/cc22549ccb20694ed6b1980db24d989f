 Prominent and notable Gospel music minister, Blessings NG Drops a spirit-filled and soul-lifting song, “Ogini” Speaking about the song , she shares: “The song Ogini talks about serving God with all our hearts, even if we use sand, cement, woods or other building materials to build house for our God, it is not enough for him, we can only use our hearts to build for him, cos the Bible says that your body is a temple of God. “Ogini” is a very powerful song that springs out from a responsive heart that is impacted by Grace (Unmerited favor), it’s all about Christ and his finished works on the cross” DOWNLOAD AUDIO  Lyrics Of Ogini by Blessings Ng Ogini kam geji we kele gi
