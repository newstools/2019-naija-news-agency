Crystal Palace’s Premier League campaign gets back underway this Saturday. Roy Hodgson’s side will welcome Premier League champions Manchester City to Selhurst Park. The Eagles have had a decent start to the 2019/20 season, winning four, drawing two and losing two of their eight PL outings. Those results put Palace to a very respectable 6th place in the English top-flight, just two points behind their upcoming opponents. As for Man City, they will be desperate to pick up all three points on Saturday. The Citizens have not had the greatest start to the season and as a result, already find themselves eight points behind table-topping Liverpool. Liverpool play Manchester United on Sunday this weekend, so Pep Guardiola’s side can close the gap to five points with a win over Palace, for a day at least. However, City will no doubt be wary of the damage Hodgson’s men are capable of inflicting. Palace would beat Man City 3-2 at the Etihad last season with Andros Townsend scoring that superb goal. While Palace will no doubt be hoping for a similar result to the one they managed in Manchester last season, they could be without one of their centre-backs for the tie. Mamadou Sakho has missed Palace’s last two league outings vs Norwich and West Ham with the Evening Standard claiming the Frenchman has been out with a strain. However, the ES are also reporting that Sakho is a doubt for Saturday’s game with Man City. Roy Hodgson had hoped to have Sakho back after the international break but the defender is yet to return to full first-team training, according to the Evening Standard.
