Banky W made this announcement with excitement through his Instagram page just few minutes ago as he reveals EME would be the management company to handle the official affairs of Mike and his wife going forward. He wrote; “Aireys is unquestionably one of the most focused housemates EVER in the history of #bigbrothernaija. Even BEFORE he got on the show, he was an ambitious and accomplished athlete and Businessman – with his stellar line of Beard Oil, Caps and @aireyyscigars (first black owned cigar company in the UK). Proud of the classy way he carried himself during the show, and excited to be partnering with him and his incredible wife @itspsd on their vision and plans going forward. “Glad to announce that Mike has signed to @theofficialeme_‘s management division. Welcome Mike and Perry to the family!!! Thank you for trusting us. We will build something special together by God’s grace: @iredeadunni with moral support from @aoquadry.”   #ManlikeMike – @aireyys is unquestionably one of the most focused housemates EVER in the history of #bigbrothernaija.
