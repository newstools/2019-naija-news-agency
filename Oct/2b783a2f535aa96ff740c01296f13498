Manchester United and Liverpool went head-to-head on Sunday. Liverpool began the day knowing Manchester City had reduced their lead at the top of the table to five points after Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men beat Crystal Palace on Saturday. But Liverpool should still have been full of confidence as they were yet to lose a league game this campaign before kicking off at Old Trafford. As for Man United, they began the day down in 14th place but a win vs Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs men would have seen them move up to 7th. Liverpool would welcome back Alisson vs Man United with the Brazilian featuring for the first time since the opening day of the PL season vs Norwich.

Manchester United would suffer an injury shortly before kick-off as well with Axel Tuanzebe being replaced by Marcos Rojo in the starting eleven.

Manchester United would begin the Liverpool game with a new-look set-up at the back. United often opt for a four-back formation under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. However, the Norwegian evidently thought he needed to change things up a bit to cope with the Champions League holders. The Reds Devils would start Sunday‚Äôs game with a three/five-back formation with Ashley Young and Aaron Wan-Bissaka occupying the wing-back roles. While you may have presumed Man United started with five defenders in order to cope with Liverpool‚Äôs eyewatering attack, it was actually quite the opposite in the opening exchanges. Both AWB and Young would start the game fairly high up the pitch, getting at Liverpool and pressing their full-backs. In theory, this seemed like a bright idea from OGS as Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson are a big driving force in Liverpool‚Äôs creativity. But with the Liverpool pair having to worry about Young and Wan-Bissaka getting in behind them, they should have been forced to drop back a bit, which would mean Liverpool had less of a creative outlet going forward. United‚Äôs wing-back system would produce fairly positive results in the opening 45 with TAA looking fairly uncomfortable at the back. Despite the success of the high pressing wing-backs in the first-half, United dropped off more in the second 45 and this in hindsight, looks to have been a mistake on Solskjaer‚Äôs part as it invited pressure from Liverpool who eventually equalised through Adam Lallana.

(Photo by Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images) Unsurprisingly, VAR was once again a talking point in Liverpool and Man United‚Äôs tie The new technology was brought to the forefront on Saturday during the Tottenham vs Watford clash with the screen in the stadium projecting a contradictory decision to what was actually awarded. Now, at Old Trafford, VAR would play a role in Manchester United‚Äôs opening goal. Solskjaer‚Äôs side would break with pace through Daniel James with the Welshman whipping a fine ball into the Liverpool penalty area. Marcus Rashford would then sell Joel Matip with his run before tapping home the opening goal in the 37th minute. However, the controversy arose in the build-up to said goal. Divock Origi looked to be fouled by Victor Lindel√∂f before Scott McTominay took possession off the ball and set James away on his run to set up Rashford. After Rashford had scored VAR would review the decision, yet despite it looking as though Origi was clipped by the United defender, the goal still stood. Huge VAR controversy at Old Trafford!

That call actually looked to be the correct one but it begs the question, if VAR could rule out Mane‚Äôs strike, why did it not rule out Rashford‚Äôs for what looked a pretty clear foul?

From struggling to even crack the top six, the Reds are now one of the best sides in the English top-flight. Klopp would also earn Liverpool their 6th Champions League title earlier this year. But while Liverpool‚Äôs transformation under the former Borussia Dortmund man has been spectacular, Klopp is still struggling at Old Trafford. Prior to Sunday‚Äôs game, Klopp had taken his Liverpool side to Old Trafford on four separate occasions. Klopp would draw with United at Old Trafford in March of 2016 in the Europe League. Liverpool would draw 1-1 with Man United in the PL in January of 2017 before losing there once again in the league in March of 2018. Then last season at Old Trafford, Liverpool were held to a 0-0 draw. 4 ‚Äì In his Liverpool career, J√ºrgen Klopp has managed more away games against Manchester United without victory than he has any other side in all competitions (D3 L1).

However, Klopp shouldn‚Äôt be solely to blame for their draw vs Man United. The likes of Fabinho, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Robert Firmino were awful by their usual standards.
