A hugely amusing story has emerged from Liverpool’s 4-1 win over Genk in the Champions League on Wednesday evening. The European champions romped to a 4-1 win in Belgium, thanks to goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (2), Sadio Mane and Mo Salah. It was a big night for The Ox, who claimed a brace, with the second a terrific outside-of-the-boot effort. A fine away match for the travelling faithful, unless you went to the wrong Belgium city, as it has emerged happened to two Liverpool fans. According to Belgian website Sporza.Be, two Liverpool fans failed to make the game in Genk, as they travelled to another Belgian city by the name of Gent. As a result, they were spotted desperately searching for the stadium in Gent, thirty minutes before kick-off. Whilst there is a Gent team that play in Belgium’s top flight, the two Liverpool fans were unable to find the match they were looking for. Too late to make it to the Champions League game, they were left to watch the match in a local cafe, where they took a rather embarrassed photo. See below. It wasn’t all bad for the two Liverpool supporters. Gent, who play Wolfsburg in the Europa League on Thursday night, have publicly invited the pair to tonight’s match. It is unclear whether they will take Gent up on that offer, or have already returned to Liverpool. See the Tweets from Gent below. 🇧🇪Als iemand deze twee kent of hun gegevens heeft, zeg hen dat ze vanavond welkom zijn in de Ghelamco Arena voor #GntWol! 🇬🇧 If anybody knows these two or has their contact details, tell ‘em they’re invited for our game against @VfL_Wolfsburg tonight.https://t.co/rtr90pYMqo — KAA Gent (@KAAGent) October 24, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js We’ll give them some lessons on Belgian geography afterwards 🤣 #genk #gent pic.twitter.com/TlE0rMGyG5 — KAA Gent (@KAAGent) October 24, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Shout out to the two Liverpool supporters who went to Gent instead of Genk yesterday, and so missed the game. https://t.co/Zg30Qx5A51 pic.twitter.com/uTxNQiWcQw — Daniel Storey (@danielstorey85) October 24, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js   Nice to get a couple of goals tonight ⚽️ good win in the end but still work to do.
