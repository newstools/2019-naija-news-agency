Liverpool came so close to lifting their first Premier League title last season. Jurgen Klopp’s side amassed a staggering 97 points in the 2018/19 season. Yet it still wasn’t enough for the Reds to lift the title with Manchester City pipping them to the post by a single point. But Liverpool have now hit the ground running in the 2019/20 campaign, winning all eight of their opening PL ties. Manchester City, on the other hand, have already been dealt two defeats in the league. And they have been held by Tottenham to a draw. This has given Liverpool a commanding eight-point lead at the top of the table.

Given Liverpool blew a seven-point lead in last season’s title race, you can understand the midfielder’s scepticism. That seven-point gap was also there in January of last season and we are only in early October right now so Liverpool really shouldn’t get too carried away. When speaking about the title race, Wijnaldum stated: “We don’t want to think we are already champions. That would be a really wrong thing to do. “I’m sure the manager will keep us with our feet on the ground and say that we just have to think about ourselves, and try to play good and try to give 100 per cent every week. “We just have to do what we did before and look at ourselves and not look too much to other teams because we don’t have influence on other teams – we can’t control the performance of other teams. “We just have to make sure we are ready for the games that are to come and to make sure we are ready and try to have good results because we know that it can change quickly. “Then at the end of the season we will see where we stand.” As quoted by the Evening Standard.
