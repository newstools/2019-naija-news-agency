Crystal Palace face a trip to the Emirates on Sunday the 27th of October. The Eagles start the weekend 6th in the Premier League and with the chance of leapfrogging their opponents Arsenal with a win on Sunday. The Gunners are, as of writing, 5th in the English top-flight, just one point above Palace. Arsenal are also not in especially good form prior to Sunday’s clash. Unai Emery’s side put on a rather lackluster display on Monday. They were put to the sword by Sheffield United. Arsenal looked set for another loss on Thursday when they found themselves 2-1 down to Vitoria SC in the Europa League. However, Nicolas Pepe would come off the bench to score a brace of free-kicks and rescue an altogether-underserved three points for the Gunners. So, Palace should have some confidence of emerging with a victory on Sunday.

According to Sky Sports News, Arsenal reportedly bid £40m for the Ivorian in July. But after no move materialised over the summer, Hodgson is claiming that Zaha was not close to a move to the Emirates. When asked how close Zaha was to moving to Arsenal, the Palace boss stated: “Not very close at all as far as I know. “I believe that the money that was offered which was widely reported was reasonably accurate, and of course that was way below our valuation.“ As quoted by Sky Sports News. Hodgson is also expecting a good display out of Zaha, despite it being against Arsenal: “I don’t think the fact it is Arsenal will change his performance enormously – I would hope not, because I’m expecting his performance to be very good against all the teams we play.“ As quoted by Sky Sports News.
