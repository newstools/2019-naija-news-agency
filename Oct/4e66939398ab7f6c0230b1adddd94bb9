Manchester City have had a torrid time with injuries recently. Leroy Sane is a long-term absentee after picking up an injury in the 2019 Community Shield. But perhaps City’s biggest issues are coming from the back. Aymeric Laporte is expected to be sidelined until around January/February time. Both John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi have had to deal with injuries in recent weeks. And currently, both Rodri and Oleksandr Zinchenko are out of action for the Citizens. Rodri would fill in at centre-back vs both Atalanta and Crystal Palace. Fernandinho, another player temporarily tasked with the role of central defender is also suspended for Man City’s next clash after picking up a red vs Aston Villa. As a result, when speaking about City’s injuries problems, Pep Guardiola was unsure if City can handle it for a long time and against top teams: “The problem for the short term, we can handle it. For a long time, I don’t know. “Of course, against top, top, top, top teams when you don’t have players playing in their own position, I don’t know what’s going to happen. “We don’t have Fernandinho for the Carabao Cup, we have to play another one. “We have an academy and we have other solutions, and when the spirit is correct and you want to help, always you go through. It is what it is. “These situations exist in football, especially in one season, one long season.” As quoted by ESPN.

The Sky Blues will face Southampton at the Etihad on Tuesday evening in a League Cup clash. Man City have won the last two League Cup finals and will no doubt be keen to make it three in a row. City then welcome back Ralph Hasenhuttl’s men on Saturday for a Premier League tie.   Happy Sunday! 🤩⠀ ⠀ #ManCity A post shared by  Manchester City (@mancity) on Oct 27, 2019 at 10:20am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js See also: Guardiola: Grealish an exceptional player but too expensive for Man City After review, Man City’s 2nd goal vs Aston Villa awarded to David Silva, not KDB Source: Great Goals
