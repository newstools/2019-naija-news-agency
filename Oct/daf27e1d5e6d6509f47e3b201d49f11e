Reports across the European media suggest that Manchester United have been joined by Everton in the race to sign Lyon star Moussa Dembele. 23-year-old hitman Dembele made a return to his home country last summer, when the Frenchman joined Lyon from Celtic for â‚¬22 million. And, on the back of an impressive stint with the Scottish champions, Dembele has since gone on to carry his goalscoring exploits back to Ligue 1. The powerful attackerâ€™s debut season at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais saw him rack up 20 goals and 6 assists across all competitions.

The last couple of weeks have seen Manchester United heavily-linked with a swoop for Dembele. Duncan Castles even went as far as to claim that contact has already been established on the part of the Red Devils: â€˜I can tell you there has been contact between Manchester United and individuals close to Moussa Dembele to assess the playerâ€™s interest in the move and to work out what the cost would be in terms of salary.â€™ As per further updates across Europe over the last 48 hours, though, one of Unitedâ€™s Premier League rivals look set to rival the Manchester giants in the race for Dembeleâ€™s signature. The outfit in question are Everton. The likes of the Guardian (via Goal), the Sun and Football Insider all suggest that the Toffees have firmly entered the fray for Lyonâ€™s star striker. According to FI: â€˜A French source has told Football Insider that Dembele regards a transfer to an elite Premier League club as the logical next step in his career.â€™ Roy Keane urges Man United to swoop for Harry Kane after Liverpool draw Sheffield United vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
