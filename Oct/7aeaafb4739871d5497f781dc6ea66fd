Brighton manager Graham Potter has this evening provided an update on the fitness of a pair of his side’s key attackers, ahead of their meeting with Everton this weekend. The Seagulls are set to welcome Marco Silva’s outfit to the Amex on Saturday afternoon, for their latest Premier League outing. Brighton head into proceedings on the back of a disappointing result last time out, which saw the East Sussex outfit downed by 2 goals to 1 at Aston Villa. This leaves Potter’s men sitting just a point above the relegation zone, in 16th-place. Everton, meanwhile, only sit a point clear of their hosts this weekend. Unlike Brighton, however, the Merseyside club will enter the matchup brimming with confidence. This comes after the Toffees put a 4-game losing streak in the Premier League firmly behind them last time out, with a dominant 2-0 win over West Ham. As such, ahead of what is no doubt set to prove a tough test for his side against Everton, Graham Potter this evening provided updates on the fitness of a number of the club’s stars. First, the Brighton boss confirmed that both Bernardo and Jose Izquierdo are set to miss out this weekend: 💬 “Bernardo and Jose Izquierdo are still out, everyone else is in good shape. “Izquierdo has had some time out on the grass, but not with the team yet.”#BHAFC 🔵⚪️ pic.twitter.com/rjrjuAIzFW — Brighton & Hove Albion ⚽️ (@OfficialBHAFC) October 24, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js There was also positive news for fans of the Seagulls, though. Summer signing Leandro Trossard is available to start, after only making the Brighton bench last time out, on the back of a month on the sidelines with a groin injury: Leandro Trossard “is an option” following his recovery from a groin injury. The Seagulls attacker suffered a setback with the national team in September. #BHAFC https://t.co/h6M5o0bXP4 — Ben Dinnery (@BenDinnery) October 24, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Burnley vs Chelsea betting tips: Premier League match preview and predictions Manchester City vs Aston Villa betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Brighton vs Everton betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
