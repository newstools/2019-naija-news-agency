Everton winger Bernard this afternoon picked up a worrying injury, during the club‚Äôs meeting with Brighton & Hove Albion. Marco Silva‚Äôs men travelled to the Amex Stadium a short time ago, for their latest Premier League outing. The Toffees headed into proceedings on the back of a much-needed, morale-boosting 3 points last time out, when they put West Ham to the sword by 2 goals to nil, in a dominant display. This brought to an end a run of 4 straight league defeats for Everton. As such, the Merseyside outfit no doubt entered this afternoon‚Äôs exchanges with their tails up. When all was said and done at the Amex, however, the visitors were brought firmly back down to earth. A hectic 90 minutes eventually saw Brighton emerge with a 3-2 win, as Neal Maupay‚Äôs penalty 10 minutes from time was followed by a Lucas Digne own goal, to turn Everton‚Äôs advantage on its head. And an altogether-miserable afternoon for Marco Silva‚Äôs outfit was also compounded by a blow on the injury front. The player to have picked up the problem was attacker Bernard. With the turf soaked and slippery due to heavy rain, the Brazilian went to ground off the ball, before immediately clutching at his knee in evident pain. This eventually saw Bernard replaced by Gylfi Sigurdsson, with the former having been helped off the pitch by a pair of Everton physios. 29‚Ä≤ Bernard falls awkwardly and is replaced by Sigurdsson.
