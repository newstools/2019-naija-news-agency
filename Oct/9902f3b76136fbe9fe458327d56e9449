Manchester United have this evening provided an explanation for the last-minute change to the club’s backline, for their meeting with Liverpool. The latest edition of English football’s most historic rivalry is currently underway at Old Trafford. Judging by the state of the Premier League table ahead of kick-off, though, one could have been forgiven for momentarily forgetting that it was hosts Manchester United who for so long dominated Liverpool over years gone by. As things stand, it is the Merseysiders who sit pretty atop the English top-flight, having racked up wins in all 8 of their league outings to this point in the campaign. United, on the other hand, had slipped to 15th before proceedings got underway in Manchester this evening. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men had notched just a solitary win in their last 5 fixtures across all competitions before today. And the hopes of the Red Devils of turning things around with a morale-boosting 3 point-haul versus their fierce rivals was dealt a further dent ahead of kick-off. With the likes of Luke Shaw, Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard already sidelined with respective fitness problems, another of the club’s stars was forced to pull out of United’s starting line-up at the last minute. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s original XI to take on Liverpool read as follows: Today’s #MUFC starting XI! 📝#MUNLIV — Manchester United (@ManUtd) October 20, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Just moments before the clash getting underway at Old Trafford, however, it was confirmed that young defender Axel Tuanzebe had been pulled from the hosts’ line-up. Manchester United subsequently revealed that Tuanzebe picked up an injury during this evening’s warm-up. Marcos Rojo was the man chosen to replace Tuanzebe at the heart of the club’s backline: ⚠️ We’ve been forced to make a change to our line-up: ▪️ Tuanzebe has picked up an injury in the warm-up
