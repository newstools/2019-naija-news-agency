You could say that Nollywood actress Lala Akindoju has found her people. The Nigerian hit filmmaker just can’t get over online store ZAZAII. The store, which sells contemporary fashion items from independent designers has become her one-stop-shop for every single event. To the Big Brother Naija house last week, she opted for a multi-coloured set from clothing brand Fruché from the store. She paired it with a ponytail and simple stud earrings.   On day 2 of the LCA Film Festival, she went for a monochromatic look, a short dress from Fruché also from ZAZAII.  Click here to place your order on the ZAZAII website.
