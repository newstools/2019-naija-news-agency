A concerning sequence of events involving Manchester United winger Daniel James has been garnering widespread attention online this evening. James’ Wales welcomed Croatia to the Cardiff City Stadium a short time ago, for their latest Euro 2020 qualifier. The visitors headed into proceedings sitting pretty atop the Group E table. Ryan Giggs’ hosts, meanwhile, sat 4th, 6 points adrift of their opponents (albeit having played a game less). As such, with Hungary having secured a 1-0 win over Azerbaijan already today, Wales no doubt entered their latest outing desperate for a much-needed 3-point haul. When all was said and done in the country’s capital, however, the Dragons were forced to settle for a draw. Croatia took the lead inside the opening 10 minutes of the clash, courtesy of Nikola Vlasic. Wales, though, soon fought back, notching a timely equaliser just before the interval, through star man Gareth Bale: Huge goal for Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 If there’s one man you want in on goal, it’s Gareth Bale!

Result aside, meanwhile, another major talking point to have been taken away from Wales’ draw this evening surrounded an incident involving Daniel James. As the Manchester United summer arrival rose for a header during the early exchanges in Cardiff, he was inadvertently caught by the knee of the arriving Domagoj Vida. This saw James hit the ground hard, before lying motionless on the turf, in truly worrying scenes. After appearing to come to, the 21-year-old was quickly seen to by the hosts’ medical team, as he regained consciousness. However, much to the surprise of viewers, James was then, just minutes later, allowed to return to the action, despite having picked up what at one point looked a potentially-serious head injury. Safe to say, the online reaction has since been heavily-critical, with many having called into question football’s concussion protocol: Daniel James was just knocked out unconscious! Yet 3 minutes later he has been allowed back onto the pitch 🤷‍♂️ — Ryan Mason (@RyanMason) October 13, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Daniel James clearly knocked out there. Why oh why is he allowed back on the pitch? Incredibly dangerous from the Wales medical staff.
