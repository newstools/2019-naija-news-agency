The reliable James Benge of football.london has this evening delved into the reasoning behind Mesut Ozil once again being omitted from Arsenal’s matchday squad. Unai Emery’s men are currently locked in action with Portuguese outfit Vitoria SC, in their latest Europa League outing. The Gunners headed into proceedings aiming to extend their advantage atop the Group F table, on the back of 2 wins from 2 thus far. Arsenal’s last European fixture saw the north Londoners put Standard Liege to the sword by 4 goals to nil, courtesy of a superb performance. Vitoria, on the other hand, are yet to pick up a point to this point in their Europa League adventure. As such, ahead of kick-off this evening, Arsenal were understandably viewed as clear favourites to emerge victorious. An hour prior to the clash getting underway at the Emirates, meanwhile, Unai Emery named his starting XI. The lineup featured the likes of the returning Alexandre Lacazette, summer signing Kieran Tierney and explosive youngster Gabriel Martinelli: 📋 Our team news for tonight’s @EuropaLeague fixture… 🇫🇷 @LacazetteAlex starts
🇪🇸 @HectorBellerin captains the side
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 @KieranTierney1 also in the XI
🇧🇷 Martinelli earns another starting place 🏆 #UEL — Arsenal (@Arsenal) October 24, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As showcased above, however, there was again one significant absence from not only Arsenal’s XI, but the club’s matchday squad altogether. The player to have missed out was Mesut Ozil. German midfielder Ozil has majorly struggled for game-time this season, with his complete absence versus Vitoria this evening having marked his 5th-straight across all competitions. As such, questions are inevitably beginning to mount regarding whether or not the former Real Madrid man has any kind of future left in north London. One individual who certainly does not feel as though Ozil does, though, is Arsenal reporter James Benge. Writing for football.london a short time ago, Benge provided an insight into the 31-year-old’s latest omission, suggesting that it simply highlights the fact that Ozil’s Gunners career is on the verge of coming to an end: ‘Right now it’s merely about hammering the final nails in the coffin of his Arsenal career. Like it or not we’ll be seeing very little of the club’s best-paid player in the coming weeks and months.’ ‘And that is not just due to Emery. To be clear, he has Raul Sanllehi’s backing on this. Arsenal have been trying to sell Ozil for a year now.’ Burnley vs Chelsea betting tips: Premier League match preview and predictions Manchester City vs Aston Villa betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Brighton vs Everton betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Source: Great Goals Arsenal manager Unai Emery last night dropped the latest hint that Mesut Ozil is not part of his plans, after leaving the German out of the club’s squad that put Standard Liege to the sword.
