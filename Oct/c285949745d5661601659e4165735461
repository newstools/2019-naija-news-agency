Guys! After a phenomenal 99 days, the Big Brother Naija Pepper Dem show has really come to an end. 99 days, 26 housemates, 23 evictions, one disqualification, and ₦60 million in prizes! Fans of some housemates are probably somewhere bristling, upset that their fave did not win. Still, Africans have made their decisions, casting a whooping 50 million votes to crown Lamborghini Mercy the winner of the 4th season of the #BBNaija Pepper Dem show! Whoop! The finale may not have gone how you thought, how you hoped, or how you wanted, but you cannot deny that it was an unforgettable show filled with unforgettable moments. So out of those very many unforgettable moments, here are five that won’t be leaving our minds … ever! Ebuka and his wardrobe Guys. Seriously. How does Ebuka do it? How does he stay consistent, week after week, giving us mad attires that do not just look perfect on him, but also challenge our idea of what dressing as a Nigerian man should be. Ebuka Obi-Uchendu is a fashion icon. Tonight, to give an epic ending to a season of impressive style, his theme was Shine Shine Bobo. First, Ebuka arrived the stage in black pants and a blinged-out blazer (that weighed 9kg!) made by Mai Atafo, paired with equally blinged-out loafers.  Fun fact: This dazzling tuxedo actually weighs over 9 kilograms  Tune in now let’s enjoy the #BBNaija finale together!!! Meanwhile, beard gone. Goatee is here!!! #ManLikeEbuka  #PaidPartnershipWithGillette #ShaveWithGillette #BestManCanGet  Outfit: @maiatafo  Shoes: @313eko  Photo: @theoladayo A post shared by  Ebuka Obi-Uchendu (@ebuka) on Oct 6, 2019 at 11:03am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js As if that wasn’t enough for one night, as if that wasn’t enough to end the show with, Ebuka arrived with a wardrobe change that continued his Shine Shine Bobo theme: a Mai Atafo-designed agbada, embroidered with stones, and matching it with a blinged-out cap.  Quick change but still blinging  Time to crown our #BBNaija winner!!!

Mercy declaring love for Ike We’ve had several relationships in the BBNaija Pepper Dem house this season. Gedoni and Khaffi. Esther and Frodd. Diane and Elozonam. And when the housemates all left the house, asked by Ebuka what they felt about the relationships, we always got shifty answers. It’s like they were all skeptical about putting their hearts on the line, afraid to commit lest they leave the house and find that what they had wasn’t genuine. But not Ike and Mercy. Mercy straight up said it: I love Ike. I love his “stupid a**.” They’re like twins, she said, liking and hating the same things. And maybe this honesty of hers, this clarity of feeling, is why Africa chose her as their winner! Mercy says she fell in love with Ike’s “stupid ass.” She loves him, she says. She says they’re like twins. They like the same things and hate the same things.#BBNaija #BNxBBNaija4 #Bet9jaBBNFinale — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) October 6, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Mercys boo waiting for her with som fresh Flowers…. #bbnaija pic.twitter.com/Y4qzkXPByV — mercy & ike till 99th day (@ToreBiba) October 6, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Mike unable to close his mouth after spotting his wife The men in this season of BBNaija have proved that Nigerian men are faithful people. Nigerian men don’t cheat! From Sir Dee to Seyi to Tuoyo, they all insisted they had girlfriends and love interests waiting for them outside the house, and that they weren’t interested in pursuing anything romantic inside the Pepper Dem house. And they all kept their words. Enter Mike – the only married man in the BBNaija Pepper Dem house. Mike got married shortly before the start of the show, and made it clear that he had no intention to cheat. With his conduct inside the house, it didn’t even seem like a possibility – him cheating. There was so much discipline, so much grace, so much finesse, endearing him into all our hearts. Climbing the stage before the final winner was announced, Mike spotted his wife Perri among the audience, and immediately he stood still and went open mouthed.

The Performances (#NoSnakes) Tonight’s performances were extra! It was A list after A list after A list! Twice we got Patoranking (thrice?) performing so many of his hits for us. And we had Tiwa Savage too, the queen giving us both new and old hits. We especially loved M.I., who we hadn’t seen perform in how long, and remains legendary enough to leave us with the epic line: #NoSnakes! Truly an unforgettable moment. No ?

Lamborghini Mercy became the fourth winner of Big Brother Naija, carting home the biggest prize in the history of the show: ₦60 million worth of prizes! Lambo came
Lambo saw
Lambo conquered! Mercy really did give us a show, killing party after party, falling helplessly and totally and honestly in love, making lasting friendships, and crying and laughing her way through. Watching her wear that crown at the end of the show, and standing beside her lover Ike and her friend Diane, was just the most beautiful thing. We’re so proud of and happy for her!
