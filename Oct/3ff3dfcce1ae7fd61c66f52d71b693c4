 Drake celebrated his 33nd birthday party yesterday and threw a big bash that had several celebrities attend. The party was a mobster-themed event and he ended up getting extremely expensive birthday gifts from his pals. However, the gift that caught the eye of guests was that of French Montana’s.  French Montana bought a flashy bracelet for Drake’s wrist which was engraved with his name. The diamond-encrusted custom piece reportedly goes for over $175K which is about 63million naira. Certainly friendship goals!   #FrenchMontana got #Drake an expensive gift for his birthday A post shared by  Videowheels (@videowheelstv) on Oct 24, 2019 at 8:12pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js The post Drake Gets 63 Million Naira Birthday Gift From French Montana appeared first on tooXclusive.
