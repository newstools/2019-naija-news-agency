Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has this afternoon confirmed that star midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is set to miss the club’s meeting with Wolves this weekend. The Sky Blues are set to welcome Nuno Espirito Santo’s side to the Etihad on Sunday. Hosts City will head into proceedings hoping to keep pace with Liverpool atop the Premier League table. As things stand, the champions sit 5 points adrift of Jurgen Klopp’s early-season pace-setters. City put Everton to the sword by 3 goals to 1 in their last league outing, before downing Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League during the week. Wolves, meanwhile, have also been on an improved run of form of late. The Molineux outfit picked up their first win of the Premier League season last weekend, before securing an impressive 3 point-haul at Besiktas in the Europa League last night. And Wolves’ hopes of carrying their upturn in form beyond the Etihad on Sunday afternoon have today been dealt a boost. This comes in the form of news that City standout Kevin De Bruyne is set to miss out in 2 days’ time. The Belgian international has been struggling with a groin injury of late, and has not recovered in time to face Wolves. The former Chelsea man, along with John Stones, is expected to return to action following the international break: PEP  (On injuries) No, @DeBruyneKev is not in (for #MCIWOL). After the international break he will be ready. It’s not a big problem. Hopefully after international break John Stones will be back. — Manchester City (@ManCity) October 4, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Liverpool vs Leicester betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Brighton vs Tottenham betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Burnley vs Everton betting tips: Premier League preview & prediction Norwich City vs Aston Villa betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
