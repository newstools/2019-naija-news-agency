As per a report from Portuguese outlet A Bola, Tottenham are ready to reignite their pursuit of summer target Bruno Fernandes. 24-year-old Fernandes has emerged as one of Portuguese football’s star performers over the last couple of seasons. The former Udinese and Sampdoria man possesses all of the key traits of a modern attacking midfielder, combining a keen eye for goal, set-piece prowess, creative flair and a penchant for the spectacular. Across all competitions last season, Fernandes racked up a spectacular 29 goals and 17 assists. As a result, it subsequently came as little surprise to see a whole host of top European clubs named as keen suitors of the Sporting star this summer. Manchester City were first rumoured to have been on the verge of clinching a deal for the midfielder, before Premier League rivals Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham were all also touted as potential destinations.
