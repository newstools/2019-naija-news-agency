We brought you news earlier about Zlatan’s willingness to work with Speed Darlington. Well, it seems we would be getting the result sooner than later as both artistes vibe together in the studio to create a banging sound, touted to be titled “Astalavi.” The potential release sounds really groovy and looks like one that would be loved by all. Speed Darlington and Zlatan about to treat us with a delight. Enjoy their studio session and song snippet below. Watch video:   Congrats @akpitv on this one !! Love you my brother ??
