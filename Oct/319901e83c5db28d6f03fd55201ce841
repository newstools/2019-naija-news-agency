Reports stemming from Spain today suggest that Lionel Messi attempted to convince referee Antonio Lahoz that a language barrier was behind Ousmane Dembele’s red card during the club’s meeting with Sevilla at the weekend. Ernesto Valverde’s men welcomed the Andalusians to the Camp Nou on Sunday night, for their latest La Liga outing. The Blaugrana headed into proceedings on the back of an upturn in form of late, having put Getafe and Inter Milan to the sword over the last couple of weeks. And, when the 90 minutes were said and done in Catalunya, Barca’s resurgence continued, en route to an impressive 4-0 win. Luis Suarez opened the scoring in spectacular fashion with 27 minutes on the clock, before an onslaught on the part of the hosts saw Arturo Vidal and Ousmane Dembele essentially end the clash as a contest 10 minutes before half-time. Lionel Messi then put the finishing touches on the Spanish champions’ win with a sublime free-kick 10 minutes from time. 👏 A PERFECT FREE KICK FROM MESSI! 🔵🔴 Barca putting on a clinic against Sevilla, and it’s now 4-0! pic.twitter.com/xfy4y92AM3 — Premier Sports 📺 (@PremierSportsTV) October 6, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js An otherwise positive evening’s work for Ernesto Valverde’s men, though, was soured somewhat shortly before the full-time whistle. As Javier Hernandez burst through on the Barcelona goal with 87 minutes on the clock, young debutant Ronald Araujo, who had been introduced as a late substitute, was adjudged to have pulled the former Manchester United man to ground. This subsequently saw referee Antonio Lahoz produce a red card, much to the frustration of the hosts’ senior players. One individual to have been particularly vexed by the decision was Ousmane Dembele, who’s protests saw the Frenchman handed a 2nd yellow, and the Blaugrana reduced to 9 men. 🔴🔴 TWO red cards for Barca! 🤦‍♂ Araújo and Dembélé both receive their marching orders from the referee! pic.twitter.com/g8qiOOQA4Q — Premier Sports 📺 (@PremierSportsTV) October 6, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As per the aforementioned updates across Spain this evening, though, Lionel Messi attempted to convince Lahoz that he was making a mistake in dismissing Dembele. The official’s post-match report revealed that Dembele had labelled him ‘very bad’, following his decision to send Ronald Araujo for an early bath. Messi, though, is said to have pleaded that his attacking partner in crime does not speak Spanish well, and that his words were simply misinterpreted: 📰 — Messi tried to save Dembélé by telling the referee that Ousmane cannot express himself in Spanish.
