Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has posted an eye-catching tweet on Thursday. Hours before Arsenal’s Europa League tie with Standard Liege, Aubameyang has reacted to Borussia Dortmund’s CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. Watzke, in an interview to Suddeutsche Zeitung, suggested that Aubameyang’s move to Arsenal was motivated by money: Some go to clubs because of this money, where they have not played Champions League for years. [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang, who plays great at Arsenal, will probably be warm-hearted when he looks at his bank account, but on Wednesdays will be saddened when he has to watch the Champions League on television. In a response posted on Twitter, Aubameyang has labelled Watze as a “clown”. He added: Better for you I never talk about why I really left Dortmund Mr Watzke you such a clown. I remember that time you said we never gonna sell Ousmane [Dembele] then you saw more than 100M you were the first to take that money. Better for you I never talk about why I really left Dortmund Mr Watzke you such a clown  I remember that time you said we never gonna sell Ousmane then you saw more than 100M you were the first to take that money don’t talk about money please!!!
