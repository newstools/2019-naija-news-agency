STREAM/DOWNLOAD MP3 Rema – “Bad Commando Lyrics“ Intro;
London Bad man dem know
Dem know say I be Bad Commando
Each and every night on the road
I pray you never come near my zone
They no send me many years ago
When I dey hustle for the street on a low
Each and every bad man dem know
They know say I be Bad Commando Dem know dem know
The boy don shutdown the show
They no wan leave me alone
Dem know huh
Bow down and pray for mercy
Whenever you come near me
Girl wanna try come test me
But she can never tempt me
She wanna buy me Bentley
She wanna indirectly
Try to dey complicate me
Therefore I show no mercy Bad man dem know
Dem know say I be Bad Commando
Each and every night on the road
I pray you never come near my zone
They no send me many years ago
When I dey hustle for the street on a low
Each and every bad man dem know
They know say I be Bad Commando The post [Lyrics] Rema – “Bad Commando” appeared first on tooXclusive. Source: Too Xclusive
