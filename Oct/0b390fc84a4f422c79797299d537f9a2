Eyebrows were raised last week when reports circulated on media about Kylie Jenner going to meet up with Tyga in his studio. Kylie however denied the report, saying she only went to drop-off some of her friends who had an engagement there and nothing more.

It seems their hope to an extent has now been productive as Kylie Jenner and Tyga were spotted in the same location again yesterday. Though it isn’t clear if their meeting at a lounge in which they were seen in the city was planned or co-incidental as Kylie went to the lounge with her sister Khloe Kardashian. They got to the lounge around 1am and just after an hour, Tyga left. There are no reports of a conversation between the ex-lovers which makes it believable that their being in the same location was just mere co-incidence.
