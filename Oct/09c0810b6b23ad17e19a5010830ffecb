The Headies 2019 was a night of glitz, glamour, music, dance, happy & memorable moments. The 13th edition of the music award was held at the Eko Hotels & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos and was hosted by the blonde-gang (lol) Nancy Isime & Reminisce. While Teni, Falz, Rema, Burna Boy bagged awards, we were totally blown away by the artists who performed on stage. We can’t help but share with you six must-see performances at the award ceremony.   Here's how the #13thHeadies opened. #13thHeadies #13Headies #Headies #Headies2019 #TheHeadies #HeadiesAwards #HeadiesAwards2019 #music #PowerOfADream #BellaNaija bellanaija.com A post shared by  BellaNaija (@bellanaijaonline) on Oct 19, 2019 at 2:40pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Zaki Azzay gave us a major blast from the past   Zaaki Azzay giving us a major blast from the past at the #13thHeadies. #13thHeadies #13Headies #Headies #Headies2019 #TheHeadies #HeadiesAwards #HeadiesAwards2019 #music #PowerOfADream #BellaNaija bellanaija.com A post shared by  BellaNaija (@bellanaijaonline) on Oct 19, 2019 at 2:53pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js    @thisiswurld is now on stage at the #13thHeadies. #13thHeadies #13Headies #Headies #Headies2019 #TheHeadies #HeadiesAwards #HeadiesAwards2019 #music #PowerOfADream #BellaNaija bellanaija.com A post shared by  BellaNaija (@bellanaijaonline) on Oct 19, 2019 at 3:09pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js  Oldies but golden!
