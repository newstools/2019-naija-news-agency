You all remember Davido did the same thing last night to express his love for his fans and the contributors to his forthcoming album which is billed for a release next month. His manager has now done the same thing taking to his Instagram and Twitter to write; “7 YEARS LATER! Fun fact, we almost called the album that. It’s been a hell of a year creating this project and we are almost there. I believe we’ve kicked down a couple of doors this year while staying true to ourselves, what we stand for and the continent we represent. Phone calls, long meetings and pitches, long studio sessions, video shoots, various time zones, performing all over the world, managing egos amongst a lot of other stuff we made it! I am extremely proud of this body of work and VERY VERY proud of the marketing and roll out plan I have put together for this! Real talk I’ve had a good time doing all of this! My partner in crime @davidoofficial , you know how it goes, forever proud of you ! I Will always do my best to get the best for you! Those late nights at chalice studios in LA to Metropolis in London, the vibes at billboard studios in Atlanta or the madness that is DMW HQ in Lagos we have created a master piece! “My business partner @bizzleosikoya thanks for covering for me and allowing me to run away to chase a dream of mine! My brother @blacktycoone murdered the album artwork! @menace30bg and @lt_ddon for being the best team players, our presido @sirbanko ! @specialspesh for making everyone laugh when we were just tired, @ecoolofficial for lending his ear! @missamadi for being a G and handling some situations ! @prince_ii the contract killer! @dremodrizzy words can’t describe how much you did for this project! @iamshizzi @kiddominant @walekwame @selebobo1 @joshuaharbin7 God bless you all! November 22nd we change the blueprint! #ThePlug”   7 YEARS LATER! Fun fact, we almost called the album that. It’s been a hell of a year creating this project and we are almost there.
