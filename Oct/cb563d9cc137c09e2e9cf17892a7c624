Manchester City played host to Serie A outfit Atalanta on Tuesday evening. The Citizens were looking to make it three wins out of three in the Champions League this season. However, things did not start so brightly for Pep Guardiola’s men with Atalanta taking the lead in the 28th minute. But the Citizens were quick to respond with Sergio Aguero equalising just six minutes later. The Argentine would then put City in front in the 38th minute. The Sky Blues would go on to dominate proceedings in the second 45 with Raheem Sterling bagging himself an 11-minute hat-trick. While Guardiola should be pleased with his side’s emphatic display vs Atalanta, Man City did suffer one rather big blow on Tuesday. The Premier League champions have been having some problems in the centre-back department this season with Aymeric Laporte, John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi all suffering from an injury at some point during the campaign. As a result, Pep would choose to deploy central midfielders Rodri and Fernandinho as centre-backs vs both Crystal Palace and Atalanta. But Rodri is now the latest Man City injury casualty with the former Atletico Madrid man being forced off 41 minutes into Tuesday’s tie. After putting Atalanta to the sword by five goals to one, Guardiola gave this update on Rodri: “We do not yet (know what injury is). “Tomorrow (Wednesday), we will know. Hopefully, it will be ten days if it’s not broken. If so, then three weeks. It looks like his hamstring.” As quoted by Manchester City’s official website.
