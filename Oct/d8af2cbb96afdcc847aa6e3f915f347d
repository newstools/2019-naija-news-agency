As per a report from Spanish outlet Sport, the new date for the first of this season’s El Clasico showdowns has been decided upon. Spanish football’s two biggest clubs were set to renew their rivalry this weekend at the Camp Nou, in a La Liga clash. While it is always an eventful, passion-filled clash, Saturday’s originally-planned matchup was due to have been spiced up even further by the clubs’ respective positions in the Spanish top-flight. As things stand, champions Barcelona sit a point clear of Real atop the La Liga table, after the Blaugrana’s comfortable 3-0 win over Eibar was followed by their bitter rivals falling to a shock 1-0 defeat at the hands of Mallorca this weekend. However, as has been the talk of the European football media over the last week, the upcoming Clasico showdown has been postponed. This comes on the back of mounting tension in Catalunya, following the jailing of 9 political leaders. As such, there had since been widespread speculation surrounding just when the clash was due to be rescheduled for, with fans, particularly those with tickets to the originally-planned tie, having been anxiously awaiting an update on the situation. And, as per the aforementioned report from Sport this evening, a decision has been made. It is claimed that the Competition Committee have settled on the 18th of December as the new date for the campaign’s first Barca-Real face-off. Significantly, though, Sport’s report adds: ‘The decision goes against La Liga’s hopes of playing the game on Dec. 4. They would have preferred Dec. 7, a weekend slot. The league are expected to challenge the date.’ Real Madrid to be without Bale, Modric & Vazquez for Galatasaray clash Sheffield United vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
