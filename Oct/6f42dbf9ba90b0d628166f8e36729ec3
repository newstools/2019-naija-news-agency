Willy Boly would join Wolves on loan in the summer of 2017 from FC Porto. After a successful season on loan at the midlands club, which saw Nuno Santo guide them to the Premier League, Wolves signed Boly on a permanent basis for a fee believed to be around £10.8m. In total, before this weekend’s games, Boly had made 91 appearances for Wolves, in which he had scored eight and assisted three. The 28-year-old would also start in Wolves’ latest clash on Sunday vs Manchester City. WOLVES WIN AT CITY!!

Arsenal would bring in David Luiz from Chelsea over the summer to help fill the void left by Laurent Koscielny. However, the Sun claims Unai Emery is still looking at centre-back options: WILLY BOLY is on Arsenal’s radar after his impressive form at Wolves. Unai Emery is looking at defensive options despite adding David Luiz just before the transfer deadline. Wolves had an excellent debut campaign back in the Premier League, which saw them finish 7th and earn Europa League football. However, their league campaign has started a bit slower this time around and they began Sunday down in 15th place. With Wolves looking less likely to be playing European football next season, perhaps Boly would be tempted to make the switch to North London in the future.
