The Swedes took the lead in the 50th minute through forward Marcus Berg. However, Spain leveled in the 92nd minute when Rodrigo found the target. La Roja are theÂ sixth team to qualify for next yearâ€™s tournament after Belgium, Italy, Russia, Poland and Ukraine. Returning to Arsenal and Dani Ceballos, rumours are flying about whether the Gunners will manage to keep the midfielder at the club after this season. Ceballos joined the Gunners on loan from Real Madrid in the summer. Unfortunately for Arsenal, they failed to secure an option to buy Ceballos from Madrid when the deal expires. However, this week Spanish daily AS have claimed that Arsenal hope to sign Ceballos on a permanent deal next summer. AS reported: (Arsenal) are aware that it will be very difficult to convince Real Madrid (to sell Ceballos), but seeing how quickly he has adapted to the team and the performance he is giving, they will definitely try to sign him.
