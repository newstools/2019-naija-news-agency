Chelsea boss Frank Lampard was this evening involved in a rather bizarre exchange with a Dutch journalist, during his pre-Ajax press conference. The Blues are set to travel to the Johan Cruijff ArenA in less than 24 hours’ time, for their latest Champions League outing. Chelsea will head into proceedings sitting joint-2nd in the Group H table, alongside Valencia. After falling to a disappointing 1-0 home defeat to Valencia in their group opener, the Londoners bounced back last time out, with a crucial 2-1 win at Lille. Chelsea’s opponents tomorrow evening, meanwhile, in the form of Ajax, currently sit pretty atop Group H. The Dutch champions have notched consecutive 3-0 victories over both Lille and Valencia to this point. As such, Frank Lampard and his players are no doubt aware that they are set to have their work cut out for them in Amsterdam tomorrow evening. And it is the prospect of the test awaiting the English giants which resulted in an altogether-bizarre exchange taking place at Lampard’s pre-match press conference a short time ago. As the Chelsea boss took questions from the waiting media, one Dutch journalist pressed Lampard on why he is so ‘scared’ of Ajax. Looking understandably puzzled by the sentiment, though, the English tactician kept his cool, before brilliantly shooting down the persistent reporter in question. The exchange played out as follows: Why are you so scared of Ajax? “What makes you say that?” You look scared… “That is just my face.” You talk after Newcastle, it was ‘Ajax are so good’. It’s all about Ajax… “When Ajax is finished, it will be all about Burnley” The bizarre moment where a Dutch journalist is convinced Frank Lampard is scared of Ajax 😂 #CFC pic.twitter.com/XtHiNw7BWT — Chelsea FC News (@Chelsea_FL) October 22, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Frank Lampard provides update on Chelsea trio ahead of Burnley Ajax vs Chelsea betting tips: Champions League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
