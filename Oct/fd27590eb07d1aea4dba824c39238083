The superstar singer took to his Instagram Story to reveal in as much as he would love to forgive the girl, she has done a lot of damage at the shortest time, especially based on the fact that she did not consider the his wife Chioma who is currently rehabilitating after given birth to his first son last Saturday. He wrote; “After all the good i do for the community and people, this is what i get…my wife stays out the way, doesn’t trouble anybody, minds her business and this is what she gets after 9 months of carrying my first son….they went too far in as much as i’d like to forgive them, this one i can’t and they must face the law.” See post below:  The post Davido Re-Affirms Decision To Sue Girls Who Made Pregnancy Prank appeared first on tooXclusive.
