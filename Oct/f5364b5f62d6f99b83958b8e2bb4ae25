Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has today provided his take on Roy Keane’s claim that Manchester United should target Harry Kane to reinforce the club’s frontline. Man United welcomed Liverpool to Old Trafford last weekend, for a high-profile Premier League showdown. The two sides headed into proceedings on markedly-differing recent runs of form. Hosts United had notched just 1 win from their last 5 outings across all competitions. This left Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men sitting 15th in the English top-flight ahead of kick-off, a point clear of the relegation zone. Liverpool, on the other hand, were flying high atop the Premier League table, having picked up a perfect 8 wins from 8. As such, ahead of things getting underway, the visitors were understandably viewed as heavy favourites. When all was said and done in Manchester, however, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United held their own, to eventually emerge with a point. Marcus Rashford opened the scoring late in the first-half, before Adam Lallana notched a crucial equaliser for Liverpool 5 minutes from time. United, for the most-part, performed well over the course of the 90 minutes, despite having been up against the firmly in-form champions of Europe. Though Liverpool proved the better side for much of the second-half, the hosts were well on top over the course of the opening 45 minutes. The solitary goal to show for their efforts, however, evidently did not prove enough to secure what would have been a momentous victory. As such, after Marcus Rashford found the net for the 4th time in the Premier League this season, a key talking point in the Sky Sports studio following the full-time whistle surrounded the centre-forward situation at Old Trafford. United of course sold Romelu Lukaku during the summer, but opted not to replace the Belgian. And they have since gone on to notch just 10 goals across their 9 league outings to this point in the campaign, compared to Liverpool’s 21, and Manchester City’s hefty 29. As a result, many have already begun to question the wisdom of those in charge of transfers at United, with most of the opinion that a proven goal-scorer is a must for a club with the stature of the Red Devils. One individual very much of such an opinion, meanwhile, is Roy Keane. Speaking post-match on Sky Sports, the club legend even went as far as to name the ideal addition to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s front-line. The player in question? Tottenham’s Harry Kane: ‘Just go and get Kane from Spurs.’ ‘Easy. Just go and get him.’ “Go and get Kane from Spurs, it’s easy. What are you all staring at?” 😳 Roy Keane’s simple answer to #MUFC‘s striker situation was to go and sign Harry Kane. ✍️ pic.twitter.com/8HOygIN02a — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) October 20, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As such, speaking earlier today, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino was drawn on Keane’s comments. And the Argentine tactician actually, for the most-part, agreed with what the former Irish international had to say. During a press conference ahead of his side’s meeting with Liverpool on Sunday, Pochettino explained: ‘I heard what was said.’ ‘Of course, I respect him and admired him when he was a player. He was the kind of player who you want beside you, or as a centre-back like me you want him in front of you.’ ‘Whenever I listen to him he is very clinical in his comments. Of course he loves good players and Harry Kane is a fantastic player. We more than agree Harry Kane deserves everything.’ Southampton vs Leicester betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Manchester City vs Aston Villa betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Burnley vs Chelsea betting tips: Premier League match preview and predictions Brighton vs Everton betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
