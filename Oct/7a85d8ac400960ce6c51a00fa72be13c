Liverpool have this evening provided updates on the fitness of a number of the clubâ€™s defenders, ahead of their meeting with Tottenham this weekend. Jurgen Kloppâ€™s men are set to welcome their opponents from last seasonâ€™s Champions League final to Anfield on Sunday evening. The Reds will head into proceedings on the back of their first dropped points of the Premier League season last time out. A trip to Old Trafford saw Liverpool forced to settle for a point, after Adam Lallanaâ€™s late equaliser cancelled out Marcus Rashfordâ€™s first-half opener. The Merseyside giants have since bounced back, though, with a dominant 4-1 win over Genk on Wednesday night. Tottenham, meanwhile, also secured a comprehensive Champions League victory this week. The north Londoners brought an abysmal run of just 1 win in 7 across all competitions to an end versus Red Star on Tuesday, by means of a 5-0 victory. Liverpool, as a result, look set to face a reinvigorated Spurs in two daysâ€™ time, with Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s men no doubt desperate to carry their upturn in form back onto the domestic front. As such, speaking in his pre-match press conference in anticipation of his sideâ€™s meeting with the Lilywhites, Jurgen Klopp this evening provided a fitness update on his squad. There was largely positive news for the Reds, with Andy Robertson, who was hooked after an hour of the clubâ€™s win over Genk, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, who missed the trip to Belgium altogether due to illness, in line to face Tottenham: â€˜Yeah, we just rested Robbo.â€™ â€˜We thought thatâ€™s enough for today [against Genk on Wednesday], 60 minutes. He could do it and did it. He is fine.â€™ â€˜Trent is fine. Or looked fine, if there is no setback. He was ill â€“ ill enough to not travel with us, which is not a good sign, but yesterday he had a clearing session and if it is as it was yesterday then he should be fine.â€™ Fellow defender Joel Matip, though, remains a doubt to feature on Sunday: â€˜With Joel, we have to see. I didnâ€™t see him yet. I donâ€™t know 100 per cent.â€™ ðŸ‘Š @trentaa98 is expected to be available for our clash with @SpursOfficial. â€” Liverpool FC (@LFC) October 25, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Manchester City vs Aston Villa betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Burnley vs Chelsea betting tips: Premier League match preview and predictions Brighton vs Everton betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
