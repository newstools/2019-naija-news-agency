Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed the influence Manchester United stars Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Ruud van Nistelrooy had on him. Ronaldo was unplayable during his time at Old Trafford. Playing on the wing, Ronaldo scored 118 goals and assisted 68 before leaving to join Real Madrid for a club-record fee. During his time at the Bernabeu, he was arguably his most successful, winning multiple trophies and scoring many goals. Though, thereâ€™s no doubt that his time at Manchester United helped shaped his career. Now, Ronaldo has revealed the players who had the biggest effect on him and who he used to improve.

Cristiano claims that you should always â€˜take example from those who are doing things better than youâ€™. â€˜If youâ€™ve got a little intelligence, you look and take example from those who are doing things better than you,â€™ Ronaldo explained to France football, as cited by the Mail. â€˜Thatâ€™s what I did when I was in Manchester with Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Rio Ferdinandâ€¦ if you donâ€™t learn from guys like that, youâ€™re an imbecile. â€˜The goal isnâ€™t to imitate but to take aspects from those who are the best and adapt it to your own personality. Thatâ€™s what I did. I had some talent and I watched them.â€™   ðŸŽ¯ Marcus #Rashford hammers home from the spot and we have the lead! #MUFC #CarabaoCup A post shared by  Manchester United (@manchesterunited) on Oct 30, 2019 at 1:39pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Back at Manchester United, things certainly arenâ€™t as positive as when Ronaldo was there.
