The singer just finished a performance and was heading out of the show premises but decided at some point to slow-down in order to dash some money out to his young fans who were already present in a large number. While Mayorkun was sharing the money, he noticed a particular girl in a red dress who bust into tears and started crying profusely. Mayorkun was shocked and he had to instruct one of his aide to get the girl into the car so he could talk with her. The girl eventually got into the car with Mayorkun managing to get her tears away and put a big, beautiful smile on her face.
