Liverpool head into the weekend’s Premier League action looking to build on their perfect start to the season. So far, Jurgen Klopp’s side have amassed the maximum points available to them from their opening eight PL outings. That has given the Reds an eight-point lead at the top of the table with Manchester City their closest rivals. On paper, Jurgen Klopp’s side should really be making it nine wins out of nine this weekend. Manchester United have had an awful start to the 2019/20 campaign, which has put them just two points above the drop zone.
