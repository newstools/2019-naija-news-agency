Two of Real Madrid’s stars went head-to-head on Sunday evening for their respective countries. Gareth Bale’s Wales would play host to Luka Modric’s Croatia in a Euro 2020 qualifier. Croatia were looking to extend their lead atop of Group E whilst Wales were hoping to move slightly higher up the table. The tie would finish 1-1 with Bale’s strike canceling out an early Croatia goal. After Sunday’s games drew to a close, Croatia remained in 1st place with Wales down in 4th. At the very end of the game, Luka Modric would suffer a knock and had to be subbed off. Croatia boss Zlatko Dalić has since provided an update on the Real Madrid midfielder: “[Modric] got hit in the muscle, which is awkward and quite painful, so he had to go off. “He will certainly need a two to three-day break, but I hope he will be alright.” As quoted by Goal.

Los Blancos’ first game back after the break sees them taking on RCD Mallorca. Madrid then face off with Galatasaray in the Champions League, a game they really need to win after losing and drawing their opening two CL games this campaign. And then, on October 26th, Real Madrid must take on FC Barcelona.   Road to #EURO2020 🇭🇷 @LukaModric10 ⚽ 🇧🇪 @HazardEden_10 #HalaMadrid A post shared by  Real Madrid C.F.
