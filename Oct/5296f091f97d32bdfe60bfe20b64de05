This happened after a video of the OAP’s spread online while on set sending abusive words to the female artistes in the industry. It appears they didn’t know the camera was already rolling at the time they were saying all these things as they were ‘caught in the act.’ Tiwa Savage on setting her eyes on the video was left shocked as to why these ladies who are the ones who always talk about female artistes in the industry supporting the each other be the one to make such derogatory comments about them. She took to her Instagram page to vent and warn them to make sure they keep the same energy when they meet her in person. She wrote; “Yooo look at the so called FEMALE gate keepers #OAP that are supposed to help fellow female artists and shout that female should support each other are seen here abusing female artists not knowing cameras were still rolling
And they wonder why I keep to myself . To the ladies in this video hope you keep the same energy when you see me in person #2seconds.”   Yooo look at the so called FEMALE gate keepers #OAP that are supposed to help fellow female artists and shout that female should support each other are seen here abusing female artists not knowing cameras were still rolling And they wonder why I keep to myself ?
