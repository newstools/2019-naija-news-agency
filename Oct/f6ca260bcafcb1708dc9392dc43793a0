Barcelona played host to Valladolid on Tuesday evening as they looked to regain their spot atop of La Liga. Somewhat surprisingly, it is Granada that are currently Barca’s biggest rivals for top spot with the newly-promoted side one point above Barcelona before they faced Valladolid. However, the Catalonian giants were quick to knock Granada off their perch with an emphatic 5-1 victory over Valladolid. Clement Lenglet, Arturo Vidal Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi (2) would get Barca’s five goals on Tuesday.
