Jean-Philippe Gbamin’s agent has claimed the Everton summer signing could be worth €60million if he changed his position. Gbamin was one of several big signings Everton over the summer. The Ivorian was joined by Alex Iwobi, Moise Kean, Andre Gomes and Fabian Delph who all joined permanently during the off-season. Out of all of them, it’s possibly Gbamin who has had the most frustrating start to his Everton career. The player was thrown in at the deep end in Everton’s opening game against Crystal Palace when Andre Gomes was forced off with an injury. Gbamin then started the game against Watford, before suffering an injury in training the week after. Now, with Gbamin close to his injury return, the players’ agent has suggested a position change. first time at Goodison park the team did a good job the fans were amazing #goodfeelings#greatfeelings #toffees A post shared by  Jean-Philippe Gbamin (@jpgbamin25) on Aug 19, 2019 at 10:18am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js In an interview with Sport Mania, as cited by Sport Witness, agent Bernard Collignon has recommended Gbamin moves into central defence. Everton currently have Michael Keane and Yerry Mina in that position, but are somewhat short of cover. “It is time for him to choose a position and to assert himself at this position (central defence),” Collignon explained. “According to me, in central defence, he will become a player who will be worth more than €60m. “So it’s time for him in central defence because, in my opinion, that’s where he would make an excellent career. “At almost 24 years old, you have to make a choice. I have been Jean-Philippe’s agent since he was 15. I know him off by heart, and I am convinced that he would make a great career in central defence.” Last time at Burnley: #everton #efc #blues #toffees #coyb #burnley #turfmoor #clarets #bureve #premierleague #tb A post shared by  Everton (@everton) on Oct 4, 2019 at 3:17am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js While Gbamin will likely not be ready for the clash with Burnley this weekend, Andre Gomes and Theo Walcott could be.
