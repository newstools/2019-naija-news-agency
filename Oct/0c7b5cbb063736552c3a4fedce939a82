Former Manchester United star Gary Neville has hit out at Granit Xhaka after his incident with the Arsenal fans following his substitution at the weekend. The Gunners faced off against Crystal Palace and took a swift 2-0 lead following goals from Sokratis and David Luiz. However, Palace came roaring back, with goals from Luka Milivojević and Jordan Ayew bringing them level at 2-2. Despite the pretty entertaining game, it was Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka who took the headlines. That’s because the midfielder was booed as he walked off the pitch having been substituted. Xhaka then reacted by goading the Arsenal fans, putting his hand to his ear and also told the supporters to ‘f*** off’. Safe to say they were not happy and there has been a lot of criticism of Xhaka this week. The criticism of him has been so bad that Arsenal will offer the midfielder counselling to help him get through it. Though, Gary Neville’s comments today won’t help either. The Sky Sports Pundit has hit out at Xhaka, claiming he never learns from his mistakes. He also claimed that the player has been ‘riddled’ with ill-discipline. ‘I struggle with Xhaka full stop,’ Neville explained to Sky, as cited by the Mail. ‘I have never watched a player who seems to learn less from his experiences than Xhaka. He makes, must be, 400 mistimed challenges a match, he essentially gets booked every single time I watch him. ‘He doesn’t seem to set the tone for the rest of his team-mates with his performance levels. So what happened on Sunday doesn’t surprise me because ill-discipline, he has been riddled with it.’   Sunday Matchday!! #Arsenal #GX34 #football A post shared by  Granit Xhaka (@granitxhaka) on Oct 26, 2019 at 11:54am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js  See also: Liverpool vs Arsenal betting tips: Carabao Cup fourth-round match preview & predictions Unai Emery confirms Xhaka is ‘devastated’ after Crystal Palace, but still has ‘mindset’ to be Arsenal captain Source: Great Goals
