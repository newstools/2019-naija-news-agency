However, before that beautiful situation occur, Davido who for sometime hid the news about Chioma’s pregnancy from everyone has now taken to his Instagram Story to post a video that shows Chioma heavily pregnant. Davido in the video seems excited for what is to come as he even recently just secured a multi-million naira diaper & wipes endorsement deal for the boy who is yet to arrive the world. It is indeed a blessed family and we are happy for them. Congratulations in advance!
