France faced off against Iceland on Friday evening as they looked to cement a place atop of Group H. France started the day level on points with Turkey who went head-to-head with Albania. However, neither side did themselves any real favours on Friday with both outfits coming away with a 1-0 victory. Olivier Giroud would be the man to give France all three points vs Iceland. While one Chelsea man was scoring for France, N’Golo Kante was unfortunately pulled from the squad just before kick-off. France would announce via Twitter that Tottenham’s Moussa Sissoko would replace Kante in the team to face Iceland. .@MoussaSissoko débutera finalement le match à la place de @nglkante. #ISLFRA #FiersdetreBleus pic.twitter.com/8AqJ4s422s — Equipe de France ⭐⭐ (@equipedefrance) October 11, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js France boss Didier Deschamps has since provided an update on the Chelsea midfielder. Deschamps, speaking after the Iceland victory, claimed Kante felt pain in the adductor muscle: “He felt a pain in the adductor muscle. “He had a feeling where he did not feel comfortable to play. “I made the decision [to pull him from the squad], because maybe it could get even worse. I knew Moussa would be ready.” As quoted by the Mirror. When asked if Kante could play vs Turkey, the France boss responded: “I do not think it’s too serious for NG [Kante], but I do not have an answer tonight.” As quoted by the Mirror.
