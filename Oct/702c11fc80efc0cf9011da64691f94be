He took to his Instagram page to post a screenshot of the milestone “Fall” achieved after American Online magazine, Pitchfork made a list of the world best 200 songs of the last 10 years. “Fall” was put at number 163 position which excited a lot of Afrobeat fans and especially Davido fans. Kiddo (who is the producer of “Fall”) for this reason has now lashed out at  Davido trolls telling them that he needs to be respected even more as it is his song that has made way for Afrobeat recognition on the international scene. He wrote; “We sat in the studio and created something that achieved what generations of African music creators tried to achieve. We kicked the door down and made Afrobeats the big name it is now. I’m gunna say this for the lunatics on Twitter . Whatever you do, put some respect on that name “DAVIDO”. And when you’re doing your lil producer arguments keep my name out of that shit. God bless.”   We sat in the studio and created something that achieved what generations of African music creators tried to achieve. We kicked the door down and made Afrobeats the big name it is now.
