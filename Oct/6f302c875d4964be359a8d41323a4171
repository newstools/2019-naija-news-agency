As per a report from The Athletic, Manchester United attempted to sign both Antoine Griezmann and Fernando Llorente during the summer transfer window. After clearing out the likes of wantaway attackers Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku, and reinforcing the club’s backline with the big-money additions of Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire, Manchester United headed into the 2019/20 campaign with fresh hope of finally putting their recent struggles on the pitch firmly behind them. The season also came on the back of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s first summer overseeing proceedings at Old Trafford, a key element in the preparations of any side. What has subsequently unfolded over the weeks and months since, though, has proven nothing short of a disaster. The Red Devils have managed just 2 wins from their opening 8 fixtures of the Premier League season. This leaves United sitting precariously 2 points clear of the English top-flight relegation zone. 9 – Manchester United have picked up just nine points from their opening eight Premier League matches this season (W2 D3 L3), their worst start to a league season since 1989-90 (8 points) when they went on to finish 13th. Worrying. pic.twitter.com/oV2kDjRkri — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 6, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The Manchester giants have also not fared much better in cup competitions. Though they did manage to secure their place in the 4th round of the League Cup, Solskjaer’s men only did so via a penalty shootout victory over League One outfit Rochdale. United also struggled to a 1-0 win over Astana in their Europa League opener, before disappointing en route to a 0-0 stalemate at AZ Alkmaar. This has inevitably led to question marks over the level of the Red Devils’ squad, as well as their business on the transfer front over the summer. The recent injuries picked up by Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial have shone a light on the worrying lack of attacking depth in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad. As per the aforementioned report from The Athletic, though, the board at Old Trafford did actually attempt to compensate for the respective departures of Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku. The Manchester powerhouse are said to have made contact regarding moves for both Antoine Griezmann and Fernando Llorente. United had long-predicted Lukaku’s exit, and, as a result, attempted to coax Griezmann to the club early in the summer. The Frenchman, however, in the end, opted to join Barcelona: You were waiting for this. pic.twitter.com/vVR0Prmy0b — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) July 12, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Fernando Llorente’s signature, meanwhile, is also said to have been discussed. The Spanish hitman’s arrival was even mulled over in the Manchester United dressing room. Llorente, though, after a long summer as a free agent, was eventually snapped up by Serie A giants Napoli.
