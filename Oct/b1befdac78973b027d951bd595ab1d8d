At the end of the season, Chelsea midfielder Willian is set to become a free agent. Willian’s Chelsea contract expires at the end of the campaign. But will the Brazilian sign a new deal to remain at Stamford Bridge? After Wednesday’s Champions League game at Lille, Blues manager Frank Lampard was asked about Willian’s contract. Lampard said: I have got no news on the Willian contract. That’s a conversation between Willy, his representatives and the club. Everyone can see I’m happy with Willy on the pitch.  A 300th appearance to remember!  Great goal, well played @willianborges88! #CFC #Chelsea #LOSCCHE #UCL A post shared by  Chelsea FC (@chelseafc) on Oct 2, 2019 at 3:52pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Reece James started the Champions League match against Lille in midweek. However, midway through the second half, James was replaced for Callum Hudson-Odoi. Lampard explained why James was subbed out of the Champions League game: There were loads of signs of team improvement, and individuals. Reece James for instance was thrown into his first Champions League game and looked so comfortable. The only reason to change was tactical and his fitness because he hasn’t had many games. The young players are responding, and they have to keep doing that because this Champions League level is something else. They did well tonight and they can do even better. After losing to Valencia in their Champions League opener, Chelsea beat Lille on matchday two. Tammy Abraham broke the deadlock for Chelsea in France. Willian won the match for the Pensioners with a second-half volley. Victor Osimhen scored for Lille just after the half hour.
