Yeahâ€¦ [Pre-Chorus â€“ Dice Ailes]
All the girls know Gucci, Prada lo wo siâ€™se lo wo sâ€™ori
Came through dripping, about me
Bout me you came to test me, e ba mi o
Canâ€™t control me, canâ€™t control, Iâ€™m angry, canâ€™t console me
Canâ€™t control me, canâ€™t control, Iâ€™m angry, canâ€™t console me [Chorus â€“ Dice Ailes]
Alakori o, o shako simi,
To ba ko simi, sho lâ€™aso to mi,
Sho lâ€™omo to mi, shori motto mi o,

Alakori o, o shako simi,
To ba ko simi, sho lâ€™aso to mi,
Sho lâ€™omo to mi, shori motto mi o,
Sho lo sâ€™Canada to mi [Verse 1 â€“ Falz]
Tell me, how much you are having in your account,
Look at paper we are packing with rubber band
How much is even the whole amount,
Thatâ€™s what I am trying to understand
You aff insult me, you should apologise,
Ko sâ€™omo ti mo toast ti o come alive
To ba fe ma long, mo le summarise,
To ba loun tire gan, mo le fukanize
In your life donâ€™t you ever come my side,
Itâ€™s in my front that you want to come and shine
If you lack, o le lo ma try, your girlfriend would vanish before your eyes
All the cloth on my body cost a arm and a leg,
You wan dey ask me if I go write the cheque
Whatâ€™s wrong with you? Are you mad?
Ah Are you mad? [Pre-Chorus â€“ Dice Ailes]
All the girls know Gucci, Prada lo wo siâ€™se lo wo sâ€™ori
Came through dripping, about me
Bout me you came to test me, e ba mi o
Canâ€™t control me, canâ€™t control, Iâ€™m angry, canâ€™t console me
Canâ€™t control me, canâ€™t control, Iâ€™m angry, canâ€™t console me [Chorus â€“ Dice Ailes]
Alakori o, o shako simi,
To ba ko simi, sho lâ€™aso to mi,
Sho lâ€™omo to mi, shori motto mi o,
Sho lo sâ€™America to mi
Alakori o, o shako simi,
To ba ko simi, sho lâ€™aso to mi,
Sho lâ€™omo to mi, shori motto mi o,
Sho lo sâ€™Canada to mi [Verse 2 â€“ Falz]
Issokay, issokay, you no dey for this lane,
You no get pepper wey make brain
E lo ni, e lo ni, you no get umbrella, tele mi, Iâ€™m about to make it rain
Ah, mo tin bo, mo tin bo, Authorised like a Gomina, Gomina but mi o kowo je
Iâ€™m showing off, real work, I work hard and I no dey stop,
If you like you can call the cops, they know the job
Who wan talk say we no dey ball, we dey chop,
Check the bar, omo no be bluff, no be bluff
These brothers donâ€™t know enough, they need to stop
But you donâ€™t know we run the city, what a pity,
Cos I donâ€™t really like this publicity, what a pity, what a pity,
You donâ€™t know? What a pity [Bridge]
Eyin araye o, e wa gbami o,
Won lo n jimi wo, won fe jomi o,
Won lon wo mi o, won lo n sho mi o,
Won fe to mi o Oh what a life, (what a life)
Dey want to dey my life
No no dey want to be my wife
E be like say dey want to look alike [Pre-Chorus â€“ Dice Ailes]
All the girls know Gucci, Prada lo wo siâ€™se lo wo sâ€™ori
Came through dripping, about me
Bout me you came to test me, e ba mi o
Canâ€™t control me, canâ€™t control, Iâ€™m angry, canâ€™t console me
Canâ€™t control me, canâ€™t control, Iâ€™m angry, canâ€™t console me [Chorus â€“ Dice Ailes]
