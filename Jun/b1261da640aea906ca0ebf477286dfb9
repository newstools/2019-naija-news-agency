 Authorities say a swimmer at a Bavarian lake drowned a dog in self-defense after the animal bit his arm and wouldnâ€™t let go,Acoording to Nypost.com
Police said Friday the 83-year-old owner was walking his dog alongside the lake in Schwarzenbach an der Saale when the German Shepherd attacked the 49-year-old on Monday night. Police say onlookers tried to help pry the dogâ€™s jaws off the manâ€™s arm but were unable to free the appendage. That sent the swimmer back into the lake, where he plunged his arm â€” with the dog still latched on firmly â€” under the water. The dog still didnâ€™t let go, and drowned. The swimmer was taken to a hospital and treated for serious, but not life threatening injuries. The owner is under investigation for negligent bodily harm.
