 Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly battling Premier League rivals Arsenal for Real Madrid’s La Liga bench-warmer Dani Ceballos. Dani Ceballos is enthused by the prospect of working with Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham Hotspur as he prepares to secure a much-needed move away from Real Madrid, according to El Confidencial – surely putting pay to a potential move to Arsenal. Pochettino has established himself as a truly elite managerial talent during a five-year spell in North London, transforming Tottenham into one of Europe’s most feared sides while turning Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and co into genuine world-class footballers. And Ceballos, a player with unlimited potential and staggering natural talent who for some reason finds himself outcasted under Zinedine Zidane in Madrid, apparently thinks that a move to Tottenham would be the best thing for his development. The former Real Betis playmaker has shone at the U21 European Championships, scoring a wondergoal against Italy and inspiring a 5-0 thrashing of Poland. El Desmarque claims that Spurs would be willing to pay £45 million to rescue him from his Bernabau nightmare. Tottenham apparently face a battle with local rivals Arsenal, according to AS, but Ceballos’ desire to play for Pochettino suggests that The Gunners might just be wasting their time.
