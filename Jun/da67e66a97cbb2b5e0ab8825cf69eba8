 British housing minister Kit Malthouse withdrew from a race to replace Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday, saying he was a â€œrealistâ€� who saw that there was an appetite for the contest to be over as quickly as possible, according to Reuters.com reports. â€œThe last few days have demonstrated that there is an appetite for this contest to be over quickly and for the nation to have a new leader in place as soon as possible,â€� Malthouse, who was not a frontrunner, said in a statement on Twitter. â€œAs such, it seems right to me that I withdraw my candidature.â€� The post Housing Minister Malthouse Withdraws From Race To Become PM Source: Independent
