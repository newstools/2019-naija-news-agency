 MANCHESTER UNITED are edging closer to the signing of Daniel James after the Swansea star completed a medical. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is desperate to strengthen his squad this summer as he looks to guide United back into the top four. But the Red Devils are keen to abandon their tactic of signing marquee players, instead targeting youngsters with potential. James certainly fits that mould following a stunning breakthrough season in south Wales. The 21-year-old completed his medical at Carrington yesterday ahead of a Â£15m move and the fee could rise to as much as Â£18m with add-ons and bonuses. James had one year left on his contract at Swansea and after renewal talks broke down, the Championship side were forced to cash in to avoid losing him for free. The winger was hoping for an increase on his Â£4,000-a-week wages. And heâ€™s set for a major pay rise when his switch to Old Trafford is complete. Jamesâ€™ imminent transfer comes amid news that: Man United are right to be targeting younger players says Hislop â€œJames is set for a long-term deal worth Â£67,000-a-week.â€� According to the Daily Mail, James is set for a long-term deal worth Â£67,000-a-week. The stunning weekly wage includes bonuses and it is a huge indication of the faith United have in him. Jamesâ€™ earnings represent an incredible 1,575 per cent increase on his previous salary. Solskjaer hopes James can fix Unitedâ€™s problem position down the right-hand side but former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan has questioned the move. â€œI think this move is a risk for the young player to take his career and maybe find himself on the periphery of the first team for a significant part of the season,â€� he told talkSPORT. â€œIâ€™ve had young players who have moved to big clubs that it halted their career. â€œThereâ€™s a dynamic with this young player that he hasnâ€™t really earned his stripes. â€œHe hasnâ€™t really learned the game, he hasnâ€™t played enough to be able to land at a place like Manchester United.â€� The post Premier League Star Completes Man United Medical Source: Independent
