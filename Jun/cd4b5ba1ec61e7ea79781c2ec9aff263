 Britainâ€™s High Court on Friday threw out an attempt to prosecute Boris Johnson, the top contender to replace Theresa May as prime minister, over accusations that he lied to the public during the 2016 referendum on Brexit, Acoording to Nytimes.com. Mr. Johnson, a former foreign minister, was told last week that he had to address in court three counts of misconduct in public office over his Brexit claims. Those included a message painted on a campaign bus that said Britain paid 350 million pounds, or $440 million, every week to the European Union, money that he said would be injected into the countryâ€™s National Health Service after Britain exited the bloc. Opponents of Brexit say the figure was a wild misrepresentation made to mislead voters. The figure does not account for Britainâ€™s rebate, which is deducted before it sends money to Brussels. Britainâ€™s net contribution to the European Union in April 2016 was about Â£190 million a week, according to the Office for National Statistics. On Friday, judges at the High Court in London overturned the earlier decision, meaning that Mr. Johnson would not be called to answer the charges. The High Court did not give a reason for its decision, the BBC reported. Mr. Johnson could not be reached for comment on Friday, but he has denied any wrongdoing. Lawyers for Mr. Johnson argued that â€œpublic debate about the accuracy or otherwise of the Â£350 million continues to this day,â€� Reuters reported. Adrian Darbishire, one of Mr. Johnsonâ€™s lawyers, called the case politically motivated. In a message on Twitter, Marcus Ball, the businessman who brought the private prosecution against Mr. Johnson by raising more than Â£200,000 to provide financial backing for the case, said he was awaiting the courtâ€™s written reasons before deciding on the next steps. â€œThis is not over,â€� he wrote. â€œI have a duty to my country to keep fighting lying in politics, and I take it bloody seriously.â€� The decision removed a potential hurdle from Mr. Johnsonâ€™s ambition to be the next Conservative Party leader after Mrs. May stepped down on Friday. He is the front-runner in a crowded field to lead the party and the country. After Mrs. Mayâ€™s resignation, the 1922 Committee of Conservative lawmakers on Friday formally invited nominations from candidates in Parliament who want to run for party leader. Nominations will close on Monday, according to a statement emailed on Friday. Mrs. May will remain prime minister and acting party leader until a successor is chosen. Mr. Johnsonâ€™s candidacy and front-runner status have been called a nightmare come true by opponents of Brexit and many in European capitals, where officials foresee having to deal with a unpredictable personality in leading Britain out of the European Union. Observers say that a victory for him would increase the chances of Britainâ€™s crashing out of the bloc without a deal at the end of October, prompting dire economic consequences. The case against Mr. Johnson appeared unusual because it sought to prosecute him over a campaign pledge â€” albeit one that many supporters of Brexit have since abandoned, saying it had been a â€œmistake.â€� But it was not the first case directly or indirectly linked to Brexit since the referendum. In 2016, Gina Miller, an investment fund manager, led plaintiffs in a legal battle to secure a High Court decision that the Brexit process needed Parliamentâ€™s approval before it could begin. Such cases have managed to slow down but not stop the march toward Brexit. The post Court Tosses Case Alleging Boris Johnson Lied In Brexit Campaign Source: Independent
