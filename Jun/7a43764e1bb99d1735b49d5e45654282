 LAGOS –Â Pastor Leo Iselobho, Pastor in charge of Itire Section of the Assemblies of God Church, has urged Christians to preach the gospel to their loved ones who donâ€™t believe in Jesus. He said, â€œEvangelism is the commitment to or act of publicly preaching the Gospel with the intention of spreading the message and teachings of Jesus Christ. â€œChristians who specialise in evangelism are often known as evangelists, whether they are in their home communities or living as missionaries in the field.â€� He explained that it may be a daunting task preaching to others, and said it is the Holy Spirit that does the job, and not the evangelist. As he said, â€œThankfully it is the Holy Spirit that convicts people, embolden them, and open their eyes to have trust in Christ.â€� Iselobho also said that believers should avoid â€œleaning only on the ethical teaching of Jesus while dismissing His teaching on eternal punishment.â€� He said evangelists should disseminate messages that would on the long run lead to genuine repentance of their loved ones, saying that repentance is not a mechanical duty, but rather a heartfelt response to the conviction of sin. Â  He added that it involves not only grief over sin, but it also includes a decision to change oneâ€™s ways.Â  Citing Luke 3:8, he said, when John the Baptist preached, he challenged his listeners to â€œbring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance.â€� He explained that Christâ€™s parable about the prodigal son provides rich insights about the essence of repentance. He added, â€œThe story begins with a man who had two sons. The younger son asked for his inheritance, left home, and lived recklessly. When his money was gone and the land was struck with a famine, he realised how he had hurt his family and wasted his riches. The young man decided to return to his father in repentance.â€� When it comes to reaching out to nonbelieving loved ones, the pastor suggested that Christians should continue praying and grieving for them, saying that, â€œThey know where you stand. They know where you think they stand. Itâ€™s time to be quiet and pray. â€œBacking off your family member doesnâ€™t mean ignoring or cutting them out of your life. Rather, it means spending time with them without constantly discussing their spiritual state.â€� Iselobho suggested four things Christians can do in such cases, namely to pray for loved-ones regularly; to never hide their own faith; to express affection and remember birthdays and anniversaries; and to give them space. He emphasised that believers need to trust God with unbelieving family and friends. His words, â€œUltimately, the only way to have peace in the face of loved ones who reject Christ is to marvel at the grace of God who, in Christ, accepts us. â€œHell is not Satanâ€™s domain; it is his eternal prison. This is not his headquarters; it is his confinement. It is not his home; it is his place of torment.â€� He said following the description of the final disposition of Satan that John recorded a grim scene, saying that Hebrews solemnly states. He warns that, â€œIt is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgmentâ€¦ â€œGod saved us when we were dead in our sins, and he can surely save our loved ones with the same power that raised Jesus from the dead. It would be no less a miracle for him to save them than it was to save us.â€� The post Iselobho Urges Christians To Win Souls For Christ Source: Independent
