 Barcelona were embarrassed by Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals last month. Lionel Messi inspired the Nou Camp outfit to a 3-0 win in the first leg but the return fixture at Anfield saw one of the greatest comebacks in history. Liverpool secured a 4-0 win thanks to braces from Divock Origi and Georginio Wijnaldum to progress to the final. The Reds are champions of Europe for the sixth time in their history after Mohamed Salah and Origi scored to down Tottenham in Madrid. â€œCongratulations, @LFC, on winning another @ChampionsLeague title,â€� a tweet from the clubâ€™s official account read. Liverpool took a second-minute lead thanks to Salah dispatching a penalty after Sadio Maneâ€™s cross appeared to strike Moussa Sissokoâ€™s arm. Tottenham threatened a comeback after the break but Origi settled the tie in the 87th minute by firing home from a tight angle.

Speaking after the game, Salah said: â€œEveryone is happy now, I am glad to play the second final in a row and play 90 minutes finally. â€œEveryone did his best today, no great individual performances today, all the team was unbelievable. â€œWe will see VAR next season, but I like it now! â€œI have sacrificed a lot for my career, to come from a village to go to Cairo, and to be an Egyptian at this level is unbelievable for me.â€� The post Barcelona Send Message To Liverpool After Champions League Triumph Source: Independent
