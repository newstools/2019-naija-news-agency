Jo won ma lo’sanle…. Insama du
Jo won wa’le… Insama du (x4) [Verse 1]
What If I Say, Make You Come Chill With Me In My Place
When You Go Fit Come Maybe This Friday
Me And You We Be Chilling In My Room
We Go Listen To Some Songs with my beats by dre.
Maybe We Could Do This To The Midnight Train
Baby Ee, Because I Want You, I Want You
Yes I Want You, Ye
And Everyday Girl Iâ€™ll Be Missing You
You No Fit Deny Say You Dey Miss Me Too
Cos I Know Say Na My Music You Dey Listen Too
With Your Pictures On My Wall Everywhere In My Eyes
In My Palour In My Room, In My Kitchen Too
Baby Girl You No Say Me I Reason You
Maybe Ee, Because I Love You, I Love You
Yes I Love You [Chorus]
Oya Baby Give Me Love Oh, Eh
Jor Jor, Jor Jor,

Funmi tan oh funmi tan gan
Jor Jor, Oh Give Me Love Oh

Give Me Love Oh [Verse 2]
What If I Say, Make We No Be Friends, Make You Be My Babe
Cos I Don They Fall And E Be Like Say
Me And You We Go Runaway, We Go Go America
In The Midnight Train
Your Mummy Doesnâ€™t Even What To See My Face
Baby Ee, And I Love You I Love You,

Many Fine Girls But Na You I Choose
And All The Guys Want To Steal My Boo
Dey Get Money And They Get Body
But Nobody Else Wey Go Fit Fill My Shoes

We Go Listen Till Iâ€™m Satisfied
Give Me Love Oh
Baby Give Me Love Oh
Baby Give Me Love Oh
Now Oh. [Outro]
