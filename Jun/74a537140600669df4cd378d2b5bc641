 Thando Thabethe brought the flares out at the Cell C Inanda Africa Polo Cup. The CÃŽROC ambassador was definitely in a fashionable mood in south African designer Orapeleng Modutle 2019. The stone coloured suit was worn without a shirt, with a deep decolletage and exaggerated collar and shoulders. The cleavage baring bodice on the jacket countered the severe tailoring and brought a sexy dimension to the neutral colour scheme. The embellished sleeves also added interest to the look. She styled the look with minimal jewellery, barely there makeup and a sleek bob finished it off.
