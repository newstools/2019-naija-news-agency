 Manchester United are reportedly keen to sign two midfielders this summer, so could target Evertonâ€™s Idrissa Gueye as theyâ€™re also linked with Sporting Lisbon star Bruno Fernandes. TheÂ Daily MirrorÂ have been among the many sources to link Fernandes with Man Utd this summer, and the Portugal international looks an ideal addition after a tremendous 2018/19 campaign in which he contributed 28 goals and 14 assists to his team in all competitions. Very much an attack-minded midfielder, United could certainly do well to also bring in someone more defensive-minded alongside Fernandes, and theÂ Evening StandardÂ link the club with Gueye. The Red Devils have been linked with the Senegal international in the past, with theÂ MailÂ recently claiming they could move for him and that heâ€™d likely cost around Â£40million. Gueye has shown what he can do at Premier League level and looks like heâ€™d be an upgrade on the ageing Nemanja Matic, who showed real signs of decline last season.
