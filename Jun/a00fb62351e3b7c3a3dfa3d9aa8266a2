 It’s been a few years since Doctor Strange brought something a little different to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in his own solo adventure. A man not afraid of a spectacular glow up, accessorising with a sentient cape and a stunning piece of bling that just happened to be a massively powerful infinity stone, the story of Stephen Strange was a masterclass in a simply shocking amount of arrogance somehow surviving a brutal gut punch from fate. The movie managed to cash up at over $675 million worldwide, but Marvel was quite casual about setting up a sequel after its release. A lot of ‘mayhaps’ and ‘sure, sometime’ from puppet master Kevin Feige, and the occasional ‘I’d be up for doing another one’ from the cast and crew, but nothing concrete. Compare that to the way the studio jumped to lay out plans for Black Panther 2, and we were never quite certain that the Sorcerer Supreme would open a portal back to the big screen with his sling ring for another outing. Things seem to be getting started now, though, so here’s everything we know so far about Marvel’s plans for Doctor Strange 2… Doctor Strange 2 release date
The rumoured release date for Doctor Strange 2 is said to be either in May or November of 2021. The script will reportedly be written this year, with production set to begin in the spring of 2020. Benedict Wong, returning for the sequel as the oft-fond-of-a-tuna-melt Wong, recently told the crowd at Denver Pop Culture Con that filming is likely to get underway in 2020: “I know they’ve now got a writer on board who I met at the Endgame premiere,” Wong said. “So I think [Doctor Strange 2] may be happening some time next year.” The character of Stephen Strange may not have had his very own sequel movie to develop and grow in yet, but he’s still managed to have a hell of an impact on the MCU in the interim. Waylaid on his quest towards Wong’s craving for a tuna melt by a Sanctum/Hulk smash ceiling situation in the opening scenes of Avengers: Infinity War, Strange later used the Time Stone to look into 14 million+ possible futures for a way to ultimately defeat Thanos. Having found one, he then gave up the stone to the mad titan, and it was later destroyed in Avengers: Endgame. So, in Doctor Strange 2, we’re looking at a superhero with somewhat diminished powers. The glowing centre of the Eye Of Agamotto is no more, so it stands to reason that there’ll be no time trickery in this upcoming sequel. To be fair, Derrickson and co already leaned on that plot device pretty heavily in the first film, so it’s likely they wouldn’t want to repeat themselves anyway. Additionally, even though Tilda Swinton’s The Ancient One couldn’t see past the events of her own death in the first film, she does take a moment in Endgame to state that “Stephen Strange is meant to be the best of us” so the sequel could potentially deal with a prophecy-type situation. There certainly could be some other seeds planted in this stone-lifting scene with Smart Hulk! Doctor Strange 2 director
An early Christmas present arrived as THR confirmed that Scott Derrickson had finally signed up to direct Doctor Strange 2. The director had often spoken of his desire to return for the sequel, so this was excellent news. He does seem like a genuinely lovely man, and he recently shared that his home had been destroyed during the Woolsey Fire, resulting in the loss of nearly everything he owned. Nearly everything… We can’t wait to see what he’ll do with this sequel, now that he’s free of the whole origin story factor. Benedict Cumberbatch will once again star in Doctor Strange 2, along with Benedict Wong. It’s likely that Rachel McAdams will be back, too. Potentially, another MCU character could show up to help or hinder Strange and Wong in this new adventure. Who would you like to see make an appearance? As teased during the post-credits scene in the first film, Chiwetel Ejiofor could be the much more evil version of Mordo in this one, but we’ll have to wait and see. “What made The Dark Knight so great was that the origin story of Batman had been well-told, and then it was time to bring in a villain where you really got to go deep,” Scott Derrickson said previously. “And not just the Joker, also Two-Face. It was a more visceral experience, I’d love to be able to do that for Doctor Strange.” But there’s definitely one villain Derrickson’s been keen to develop for a while: “I really like the character of Nightmare and the concept [of] the Nightmare Realm. Thatâ€™s early â€“ thatâ€™s like the first Strange tale. I think thatâ€™s in the introductory episode of Doctor Strange, and I always loved that.” Doctor Strange 2 rumours
After the first film came out, its screenwriter, Jon Spaihts, touted the appearance of Clea in a theoretical Doctor Strange 2. â€œSheâ€™s a tricky character to interpret because her uncle is a kind of fire-headed omnipotent god and sheâ€™s kind of a hot babe who studies magic,â€� Spaihts told CBR. â€œThatâ€™s a tricky relationship to bring out of a comic book and on to a movie screen. But sheâ€™s a really compelling character as a foil, a love interest, a colleague of Doctor Strangeâ€™s, and she always carries with her that width of mystery as to whether she is human, and how human, and what that means for his relationship to her. So we might find a way to introduce her to the story.â€� It was reported back in January that C. Robert Cargill would return to pen Doctor Strange 2, but it’s currently unclear whether anything Spaihts might have once envisioned for the sequel could come to fruition.
