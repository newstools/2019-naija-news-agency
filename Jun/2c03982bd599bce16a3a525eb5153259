 Matthijs de Ligt has revealed that Cristiano Ronaldo asked him to join Juventus after the Nations League final between Portugal and the Netherlands. De Ligt is in demand with Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool among the teams hoping to sign the defender, who impressed as Ajax reached the Champions League semi-finals. The Dutch international is expected to move over the summer and Ronaldo let it be known that he would like the defender to join Juventus. When asked if Ronaldo had asked him to move to Turin, De Ligt told NOS: “That could be true, yes. “I didn’t understand him at first. I was a little shocked, so I laughed. But I didn’t say anything. “So soon after the game you are not at all concerned with it. You are disappointed that you have lost and that is the only thing you are thinking about.” Despite being linked with some of the biggest teams in Europe, De Ligt insists he is in no rush to make up his mind. “I don’t mind that. The transfer period starts in a while, so I will first go on a nice vacation and rest. I will let it happen and then I will see,” he said.
