 LiverpoolÂ managerÂ Jurgen KloppÂ believes striker Roberto Firmino should be fit for theÂ Champions LeagueÂ final againstÂ Tottenham. The Brazilian missed Liverpool’s final three matches of the season. While Klopp admitted he was ready to start, he was reluctant to give too much away about his lineup according to dailymail.co.uk. Klopp said: ‘Yes, he is ready (to start). If Poch (Mauricio Pochettino) afterwards says the exact line-up then call me and I’ll tell you. He is fit, he has trained and he is here. If nothing happened since he left the plane he should be fine.’ The post Jurgen Klopp Says Roberto Firmino Should Be Fit For the Champions League Final Source: Independent
