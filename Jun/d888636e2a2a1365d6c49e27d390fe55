She recently celebrated her son turning one. One thing however about Irene Chiamaka Nwachukwu is that, she has not let her situation of welcoming a child at 22 and being a single mom at the same time let her down. Instead she has turned her lemons into lemonade, giving them hot hot! Itâ€™s one of the reasons we still follow her on social media. Oh by the way, she just delved into beauty business too. You love? OFCOURSE lol ~
