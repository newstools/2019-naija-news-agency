 Manchester City legend Vincent Kompany has offered his support for current assistant manager Mikel Arteta to one day succeed Pep Guardiola. The Catalan coach masterminded an unprecedented domestic treble last season and was recently forced to bat away suggestions he could be planning a sabbatical if he guides City to Champions League success according to squawka.com. Guardiola’s contract expires in 2021 and he is yet to stay at a single club for more than four years, leading many to speculate he may part ways in the next few years, but Kompany believes Arteta is the “right man” to step into the equation should such a scenario materialise. Speaking at the presentation of his new player-manager role at Anderlecht, he said: “I should have expected this question and yet I’m surprised. “Let me start with this. Let City be City under Pep, which is an awesome club. I think they will win the Champions League eventually, soon hopefully. “Behind Pep there is Mikel Arteta, who has a lot of knowledge who probably is the right man to look at.”   The post Mikel Arteta Is The “Right Man” To Succeed Pep Guardiola At Man City – Vincent Kompany  Source: Independent Mauricio Pochettino has stated he might not be able to compete with the spending power of the two Manchester clubs, reports Completesportsnigeria.com.
