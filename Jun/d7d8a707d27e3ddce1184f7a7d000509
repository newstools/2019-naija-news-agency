The recently concluded TechMoney Africa Summit which was held at the University of Lagos and hosted by ace comedian and MC Tee-A ended with a lot of inspiration for tech entrepreneurs in Nigeria. The event brought together the entire tech ecosystem with some amazing talent teams, startups, who are working to solve Africaâ€™s biggest challenges using technology. Key stakeholders from both the private and public sectors were also part of the event, including the Deputy Governor of Lagos state, Dr. Kadri Obafemi Hamzat who delivered a Keynote Address. The Vice Chancellor of UNILAG, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe and other speakers also gave presentations on how to educate and connect tech leaders in major public and private organizations to solidify the growth of technology in Nigeria. The two-day event which took place from June 10 to 11, 2019 was organized by Unicorn group in collaboration with the University of Lagos. Anchoring the event, Tee-A noted with enthusiasm on how technology is creating a new kind of empowerment in Nigeria. TechMoney Africa Summit is regarded as a gathering â€˜where tech and money meetsâ€™ and the event opened up a new conversation on how African startups can position themselves to benefit from the global tech investments. As technology keeps growing in Africa, it is quite interesting to see the region picking up race and playing an active role in the 21st century after being initially locked out of access to global tech innovation due to fragmented talent pool and lack of capital. Over the past few years, Nigeria has become a very exciting technology destination in Africa and Lagos is gradually on course to take over the title of Africaâ€™s tech capital from Nairobi, which has always been known as the African technology poster child.
