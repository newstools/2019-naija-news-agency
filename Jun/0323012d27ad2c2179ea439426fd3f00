 Cardi B will no longer appear at Manchesterâ€™s Parklife festival this weekend, as the rapper continues to recover from plastic surgery procedures. The rapper was scheduled to headline the 80,000-capacity festivalâ€™s main stage on Saturday 8 June. The Parklife organisers released the following statement: â€œAs some of you will have seen, Cardi B was forced to cancel some performances in May. â€œThe Parklife team have just been notified that Cardi now also needs to pull out of Parklife this weekend. As such, there will be some changes to the previously advertised line up, stage splits and times. We are working on this currently. â€œWe are very sorry for the late notice but have only just had confirmation that she will not be able to perform. We all remain super excited for Parklife this weekend and cannot wait to see you in a completely transformed Heaton Park.â€� The rapper recently underwent breast augmentation and liposuction surgeries. In addition to the Parklife cancellation, the surgery caused the rapper to postpone three concerts in the United States last month. â€œIt is certainly an original excuse,â€� Alesco director Paul Twomey tells IQ, explaining that multi-act festivals are unlikely to be insured against the no-show of an individual act. â€œThe festival will merely adjust the line-up in terms of set times and lengths or look to replace if time allows,â€� says Twomey. However, Twomey adds, Cardi Bâ€™s excuse would be unlikely to stand up against â€œa standard non-appearance policyâ€� if in place, given that such policies â€œexclude cancellation as a result of elective surgery as this would be deemed to be within the artistâ€™s control. â€œThere is a wider cover available that promoters and the like can take out which would pick this up as long as it was outside of the purchasing partyâ€™s control,â€� says the insurance specialist. â€œInsurers would charge a higher premium for this and would look at the artistâ€™s reputation for no-shows prior to either setting a rate or accepting the risk at all.â€� Martin Goebbels, head of Miller insurance music and touring team, states that â€œa festival may not suffer any lossâ€� from an artist cancellation. In fact , says the insurer, events may be better off â€œas the act would have to return their feeâ€�. Organisers then decide whether to keep the money or spend it on a replacement. The cancellation of individual shows, however, poses more difficulties. â€œIf it were an artistâ€™s own show, the promoter would not be insured so it becomes a legal situation to try and recover the promoterâ€™s total loss,â€� explains Goebbels. Addressing the May postponements, the rapper posted on Instagram saying: â€œYou know, I hate cancelling shows because I love money. But like, health is wealth, so I have to do what I have to do. My breasts gotta heal, and it is what it is.â€� The Parklife pull-out follows Cardi Bâ€™s cancellation of a headline performance at Barcelonaâ€™s Primavera Sound festival. Miley Cyrus appeared in place of the rapper at the festival on Friday 31 May. Parklife will make its fully updated schedule available via the festival app from 7 p.m. on Friday 7 June. Performers at this yearâ€™s sold-out festival include George Ezra, the Streets, Nas, Dave, Christine and the Queens, Solange and Major Lazer Soundsystem. Parklife takes place in Heaton Park, Manchester, on Saturday 8 and Sunday 9 June. Festival director Jon Drape and co-founder Sacha Lord touted last yearâ€™s Parklife as the â€œbest one yetâ€�. Live nation acquired a majority stake in the festival, along with the Warehouse Project club nights that Lord co-founded with Parklife partner Sam Kandel, in 2016.
