 LAGOS –Â Falck Prime Atlantic (FPA), a subsidiary of Prime Atlantic Limited, has collaborated with Fire Service College, UK, to deliver specialized firefighting training to the public and private sectors in Nigeria. This announcement was made public at a press conference held at Falck Prime Atlanticâ€™s world-class training center in Ipara, Ogun state recently. This collaboration has commenced with the training of Federal Fire Service personnel in the month of June 2019 on four different specialized courses including High Rise Fire Fighting Tactics, Casualty Care and Extrication, Fire Team Leader (JOIFF) and Fire Safety Management and Fire Risk Assessment. The aim of this training is to ensure that the Federal Fire Service is equipped with knowledge and technical skills required to deliver on their jobs. This collaboration between Falck Prime Atlantic and the Fire Service College, UK, is a tremendous feat because it means that trainings that would otherwise cost organizations much more to acquire in the U.K. will now be delivered in a fully residential training center in Nigeria with the same international standards necessary to ensure effective knowledge transfer. At the press conference, which marked the start of the two-week training for officers of the Federal Fire Service, Ag. DCG Quintus G. Azogu, shared some highlights of the agenda in place to take the Federal Fire Service to the next level to ensure the safety of lives and property. He said that enhancing the knowledge and skills of firefighters was imperative, hence the emphasis on personnel training and re-training. He further stated that Falck Prime Atlantic was one of the best private firefighting training facilities in Nigeria with a reputation comparable to what obtains overseas.
