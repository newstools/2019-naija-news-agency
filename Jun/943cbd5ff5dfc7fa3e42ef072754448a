 Portugal national squad captain and Juventus star forward Cristiano Ronaldo has again been summoned to a US court, and in connection with the alleged rape lawsuit involving American model Kathryn Mayorga. The 34-year-old footballer has been served with the respective papers by a Las Vegas court according to sport.news.am.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room back in 2009, after partying together at a nightclub. In her original lawsuit, Mayorga says, in 2010, she accepted a $375,000 payment from Ronaldoâ€™s attorneys in exchange for her silenceâ€”but now, she wants that agreement voided. Last fall, the Las Vegas Metro Police Department reopened the case. The post Ronaldo Is Again Summoned To Court Source: Independent
