Real Madrid and Manchester United are two of the biggest clubs in the world, so itâ€™s all interesting to see them compete. However, of late they have been competing outside of the pitch and instead in the transfer market. This is because Real Madrid really wants to signÂ Paul PogbaÂ from Old Trafford. Watching his body language, itâ€™s easy to draw the conclusion that he would be happy with a move away as well. Now, according toÂ Marca, this conclusion has been proven right, since Pogba has admitted his desire to move to the Santiago Bernabeu this summer. Los Blancos are on the quite the roll lately. The signings ofÂ Luka JovicÂ andÂ Eden HazardÂ have already been revealed to the Bernabeu crowd, while they just recentlyÂ announcedÂ the signing of Takefusa Kubo, a young Japanese prodigy. That said, a continued chase forÂ Paul Pogba would not come as a surprise. Pogba is one of the best players in the world, that goes without saying. However, in recent seasons he has not been given the license to show it. He shows little signs of brilliance under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but overall he has been too limited by the systems he played in. It says a lot about his character that when heâ€™s at his worst, he is still the best for United. Pogba is an attack-minded midfielder. While he is versatile, he does look his best when he strides forward. This fine work on the ball enables him to contribute to attacking play, often finding his teammates in space with incisive passes. This would immensely benefitÂ Eden Hazard, since for too long at Chelsea, the creative onus was on him despite him excelling in other areas.
