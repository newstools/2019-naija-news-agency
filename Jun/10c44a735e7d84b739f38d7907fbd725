  It’s true. Too many people waste a large percentage of their energy on fretting and stewing, in useless anxiety, complaining about everything. If you’ve learned the true essence of living, you will not waste your energy on things that accomplish nothing. Instead, you’ll grind out the machinery of life by calmly working toward your aim, enjoying every day that comes along as much as you can. The first time I was to drive myself through a long distance, my mum got into her usual motherly worries. She wanted me to get a driver who would take me to Ibadan and then return to Ilaje. I asked her, “What if I get the driver and we both get into an accident and die?” She kept quiet. I drove myself to Ibadan, then to Lagos, and back home. I’m still living, four years after. Her worries were useless, on things she really had no control over. This is an example that describes some of us. You cannot effectively plan for tomorrow if all you do is worry about tomorrow. Worry will make you doubt yourself, your work, your abilities. It will make you age quicker, take away hope and joyful living from you. It will restrict you from enjoying life. Why not focus your energy on the things you can do now, things you’re doing now? Why worry about the ones you haven’t done or have no control over? Worry kills many men, more than afflictions of sickness or nature. You will live longer, healthier and happier if you banish worry from your life. You have a long way to go, and five, six, seven years from now, you would have achieved enough to realise worry is of no use. You cannot achieve great things if all you focus on is worrying about everything. Don’t focus on getting rid of the effect of worry, get rid of worry itself, and live a wonderful life from today.
