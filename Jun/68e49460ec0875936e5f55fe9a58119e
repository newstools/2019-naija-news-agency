 According to reports from AS in Spain and HLN in Belgium, Real Madrid are making their â€˜final pushâ€™ for Eden Hazard. With the clubs yet to agree on the transfer fee to be paid for Hazardâ€™s transfer, the Spaniards will send their â€˜second-in-commandâ€™, managing director JosÃ© Ã�ngel SÃ¡nchez, to negotiate directly with Chelseaâ€™s Marina Granovskaia. The fees reported by the papers are also diverting from each other. AS claims that Chelsea are asking for â‚¬120 million, although Madrid are not willing to go over â‚¬100 million for a player that only has one year left in his contract. While HLN says that Madrid would be willing to reach at most the â‚¬120 million mentioned by AS, with Chelsea asking for â‚¬130 million to let go of Eden. That is the only issue that remains unsolved in the entire transaction. Contract terms have already been agreed upon between Madrid and Hazardâ€™s representatives, and the only thing left is convincing Chelsea to let him move to Spain. But unlike most clubs, Chelsea are unyielding when it comes to selling their assets. Even when they are on precarious contractual situations like Hazardâ€™s. Madridâ€™s hopes were to announce Hazardâ€™s signing today, but that is already off the table. He is set to join the Belgium national team for Euro 2020 qualifying games against Kazakhstan and Scotland over the next two weeks, and he will only be free for over-the-top ceremonies on Wednesday next week. Until then, it is unlikely that we will see any â€œcomunicado oficialâ€� from Madridâ€™s part. But that does not change the account that things could advance in Madridâ€™s favour this week. It all depends on which version of SÃ¡nchez presents itself, whether it is the AS or the HLN one. The latter will have a much easier time convincing Chelsea that Hazard, who could be set to double his wages from â‚¬250,000 to â‚¬500,000 per week with a switch to Madrid, should no longer be at Stamford Bridge.
