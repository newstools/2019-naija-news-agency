 FotomacÂ claim Serie A giants AS Roma are interested in signing Besiktas loanee Loris Karius in this transfer window. Itâ€™s reported new Roma manager Paulo Fonseca wants to sign a goalkeeper to replace Swedish international Robin Olsen and the Liverpool man is an option at this stage. According to Fotomac, Roma could soon make an offer for the 25 year old, with a Besiktas exit not ruled out. It seems the keeper doesnâ€™t have a future at Liverpool and if he were to leave the Super Lig side this summer, itâ€™s likely he would need to find a new club. Reports from Turkish press suggest Besiktas manager Abdullah Avci is also undecided about the German goalkeeper and Karius could leave just 12 months after arriving from Liverpool. Itâ€™s previously been reported that if Besiktas part ways with Karius, then they will make a move for their former goalkeeper Fabri, whoâ€™s currently playing for Fulham. Karius made 35 appearances for Besiktas last season in all competitions. The post AS Roma Could Make Offer For Liverpool Player Soon Source: Independent
