 Philippe Coutinho will reject a summer move to Manchester United out of respect for his former club Liverpool, according to reports. Coutinho endured a miserable full debut campaign with Barcelona, after becoming the club’s most expensive ever signing following a Â£145million switch from Liverpool. The Brazilian is now understood to be considering his future as a report but will veto any potential move to Old Trafford, as report Spanish publication Marca. It is reported Coutinho has told his representatives not to consider any incoming offers from United, due to the club being arch rivals of Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool. French giants Paris Saint Germain have also been linked with the 27-year-old, with mention of Coutinho potentially being involved in a sensational deal to take Neymar back to the Nou Camp. Barcelona and PSG have not enjoyed the best relations since the Neymar transfer, in which the Qatar-backed Parisian giants activated the player’s release clause to make him the most expensive in the history of the game.
