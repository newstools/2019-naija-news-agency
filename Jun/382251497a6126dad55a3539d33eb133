 Philippe Coutinho scored twice in Brazilâ€™s 3-0 win over Bolivia at theÂ Copa AmericaÂ on Friday and spoke about the game after the match. Titeâ€™s men were booed by supporters at half-time after a goalless opening 45 minutes, but Coutinho did not seem too bothered by it all according to barcablaugranes.com. Itâ€™s not the first time Coutinho has felt the wrath of supporters this season, but his two goals in the second half will be a great boost to the Brazilian after a tough season.
