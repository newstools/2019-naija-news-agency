 LAGOS –Â Simeon Fujamade, aÂ visually impaired gospel artiste, has called on well meaning Nigerians to support artistes living with disabilities. Fujamade who leads the Simi Fuja Music Band, made this call at a recent outreach his band carried out in Lagos. Talking about the planning that went into the outreach, Fujamade said a lot was put in place prior the outreach. On the purpose of the outreach, the virtually impaired guitarist said it was a way of intimating the public with the existence ofÂ  the band and a means of evangelism. Relaying his experience and how he learnt the guitar, Fujamade said it was not easy as a virtually impaired person to learn a musical instrument like the guitar. â€œIt was the grace of God. When I started, I was afraid. But today God has made it possible. There is nothing easy in this life. Even keyboard is not bread and butter. â€œAnybody that can keep at it. What you start dropping will leave you, if you can stay with it for 24 hours every time you will master it. That is the truth about learning,â€� he said. He also talked about the support he has received from his mother, Mrs. Fujamade. â€œMummy has tried a lot. She has tried for me since my childhood. She was always there. She always stays around in my rehearsals. In learning the guitar, she was in support. Mummy brought a brother, Brother Dele to assist me. Today, he is the manager of my band. â€œThere is story before any glory. People say some people want to have glory they donâ€™t want the story, it is not possible. The person must find alternative. Nothing goes for anything. This concert will bring me out, I believe,â€� he said. On his future plan, Fujamade said he is optimistic God would use the concert to showcase the band. â€œIf we can do the concert once a month, God can use it to expose us. â€œI just tell people if you are learning anything, it is not easy except for individual determination. When I started with box guitar it was not easy at first you would make mistakes but with determination you will get it,â€� he said. Meanwhile, he said he plans to engage in more evangelistic outreaches between now and the next five years. â€œBy the grace of God, we are going to attract nations between now and the next five years,â€� he said. He also added, â€œThis outreach is just a kind of evangelism. Evangelism is more than carrying the Bible. It could be through this a terrorist will repent. It will also showcase the band, Simi Fuja Music Band will be announced by the grace of God. â€œWe started the band about two years ago, we have about 10 members in the band including back-up singers, instrumentalists etc.â€� He added that assembling the band was by the grace and leading of God. â€œA brother of mine brought the idea then we started it. One day we went for â€˜Letâ€™s go a fishingâ€™ programme of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. I ministered in song and after the outreach, my brother just brought the idea, and God has been faithful. â€œGodâ€™s grace has been there. Most of my band members usually have their own schedule, but when they donâ€™t have schedule, they would turn up, they always want to help,â€� he said.
