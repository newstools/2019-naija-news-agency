 MOHAMED SALAH believes Liverpoolâ€™s Champions League triumph is just the start of something special. Jurgen Kloppâ€™s team were in danger of seeing all their good work fail to reap reward after the agonising finish to their Premier League title battle with Manchester City. And Salah, who scored a second-minute penalty to give Liverpool a dream start in Madrid, is eager to get revenge on Pep Guardiolaâ€™s side next term. â€œItâ€™s the start of something. Honestly, itâ€™s just the start for us,â€� he said. â€œOf course we feel we can win it again next season. We play with ambition, we set targets for ourselves and the target this year was to win the Champions League and also the Premier League. â€œThe Premier League was just one point. That was also disappointing and you just canâ€™t finish your season with losing this game so we did everything and won the game today.â€� Liverpool notched 97 points in the Premier League but that was still not enough to dethrone City. Kloppâ€™s men have improved year-by-year under his leadership, however. And Salah believes that is a sign they can topple City next year. â€œWe will go next season for the Premier League,â€� he said. â€œThis is the first season we were fighting for the Premier League. â€œLast year we were fighting for the Championsâ€™ League, before that the Europa League, so itâ€™s a progression. This is the first we have fought for the Premier League and we only lost it by one point. â€œManchester City won it and it was well deserved, but we will be able to challenge now.â€œ Liverpool have a youthful swagger in their squad which suggests they can compete at the top for a number of years. When asked if he wanted to stay to see this side deliver on its full potential, Salah replied: â€œYeah, of course. I think the average age is very young, 25-26, so we have many young players and that is exciting. â€œI also think itâ€™s a great experience for us to win the trophy now, it will help us to make another step forward. â€œYou can see today that we were calmer, we had more experience, we were able to be patient and we scored the second goal in 87th minute which shows we are learning and progressing.â€� The post Mo’ Salah Drops Big Hint Over Liverpool Future After CL Win Source: Independent
