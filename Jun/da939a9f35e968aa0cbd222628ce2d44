 Ruggedman escaped death yesterday in Peckham, United Kingdom, after Naira Marley’s fans pounced on him to destroy him for talking bad about their beloved. The veteran Nigerian rapper appeared to be enjoying himself with food and drinks alongside a friend at a cafe in London when some unknown guys identified to be Naira Marley’s boys pounced on him and hit him with chairs and bottles. The singer who struggled to gain balance in order to protect himself quickly took inspiration from the popular on-going slang in Nigeria, “japa” as he took to his heels and ran so fast away from these guys to have his dear life spared. You would recall before the arrest of Naira Marley over here in Nigeria, Ruggedman made some comments regarding the singer/rapper which didn’t sit well with Naira’s fans and ever since, they have promised to show him real trouble when they find him. The trouble however didn’t come in Nigeria as it has come in the United Kingdom where Ruggedman has gone for a summer vacation and tour.
