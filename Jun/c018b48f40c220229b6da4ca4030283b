Our state is peaceful and should remain peaceful. “It is also our expectation that as a result of Ramadan, harmonious co-existence between the people of Osun will be enhanced for the continued progress of the state. “May the goodwill and blessings of Ramadan be bestowed on our people and country,â€� the APC declared.
