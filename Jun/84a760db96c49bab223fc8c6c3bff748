2 in court over alleged N8.7m fraud A man and a woman who allegedly obtained N8.7 million under false pretences from Henry Okechukwu on Thursday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. The defendants, John Anayo, 36, and Judith Ezekiel, 39, who are both residents of Ikeja, are facing a two-count charge of stealing and obtaining under false pretences. The Prosecutor, ASP Peter Nwangwu, told the court that the duo committed the offences in January 2017 at Olaiya St., Toyin Road, Lagos. Nwangwu said that the defendants conspired to fraudulently obtain N8.7 million from the complainant on the pretext of getting a car for him.

Nwangwu said that the complainant reported the case to the police and the defendants were traced to their apartments. He noted that the case contravened the provision of Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos, 2015. Section 314 prescribes a 15-year jail term for obtaining under false pretences, while Section 287 stipulates three years imprisonment for stealing if found guilty. The duo, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge levied against them. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Y.O. Aje-Afunwa admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N1 million each, with two sureties each in like sum. Further hearing in the case was fixed for Sept. 9. 2 in court over alleged N8.7m fraud
