I celebrate your 9 years birthday my son, expressing
the essence of shelter, reminiscent of how some of us grow up, with some things we never had.This GOLDEN SEAL CASTLE Birthday gift is just a step for you to achieve greater things in the future and praying that God should grant this privilege to many others.
May this little gift bring forth hope to many children, who may not be privileged to have good shelter, nurturing in them that every thing is possible.
I can’t define the future but I will try to bring more than a million smiles to your life, by bringing your dreams closer at all times by the grace of God.Â #happybirthdayÂ my prince Roy Agoda.” See the photos of the ‘golden mansion’ below:  This is one o the most extravagant birthday gifts for a child in the Nigerian entertainment industry ever.
