Nollywood actress, Gbemisola and husband, Temi Gomez loses their son. Shared with caption.. QuoteYesterday my son Eli Gomez was born. Beautiful, chubby with plenty hair. Buried him this morning at Ikoyi. I guess he was too good for this earth. May God give me the strength to be there for his mum & give us peace at this trying time. ~
