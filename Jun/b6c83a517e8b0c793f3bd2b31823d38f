 Manchester United are reportedly keen on bringing Sevilla and France forward Wissam Ben Yedder to Old Trafford this summer. The 28-year-old netted 30 goals and provided 11 assists in 54 matches last season. And now Ben Yedder has attracted interest from United with the Premier League outfit willing to trigger his £35.9million release clause, according to ABC de Sevilla. The possible move is reportedly dependent on whether striker Romelu Lukaku, who has been linked to a switch to Inter Milan, departs Old Trafford. Ben Yedder’s current deal at Sevilla does not expire until the summer of 2021 after making the move to Spain from French side Toulouse back in 2016. The striker came off the bench to score two goals in four minutes and knock United out of the Champions League in March 2018. Ben Yedder earned just his fourth cap for France in the Euro 2020 qualifying clash against Andorra earlier this month. After being called up to the starting XI just before kick-off he scored his first senior goal for his country in the 4-0 victory.
