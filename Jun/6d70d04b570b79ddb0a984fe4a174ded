 The Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) has reiterated commitment to bridge the gap between existing and planned fibre infrastructure to increase broadband penetration in the country. Prof Umar Garba Danbatta, Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) stated this at the 10th edition of e-World Forum, held in Lagos. The conference organised by Ajomedia Limited was themed: â€˜Roadmap to Broadband Everywhereâ€™. Danbatta, who was represented by Oluwatoyin Asaju, Director, Spectrum Administration, Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC), said that they have set up strategy to ensure access to pervasive Broadband through an Open Access Model in line with National Broadband Plan. He noted that this is in line with the commissionâ€™s continued doggedness in ensuring that the lacuna between the existing and planned fibtre infrastructure in Nigeria is narrowed. He added that the deployment of Optic Fibre transmission network was adopted in the â€œOpen Access Modelâ€� so as to bridge the current digital gap and deliver fast and reliable broadband services to households and businesses. He stated that adequate broadband has been globally acknowledged as the foundation for transformation to a knowledge-based economy. According to him, â€œThe World Bank has found that a 10 % increase in broadband penetration in developing countries results in a commensurable increase of 1.38% in GDP. â€œIt has also been proven that for every 10% increase in Broadband penetration, a commensurate increase in employment of 2-3% is achieved. Productivity also increases to between 5-10% with a 10% increase in BB penetration. â€œSo it is almost impossible to equate any other modern technological tool with Broadband, because of its inherent potential to address issues relating to sustainable development and simultaneously facilitate socio-economic development, while instigating transformative change in all the sectors of the economy.â€� Danbatta stated that the establishment of Broadband Implementation & Monitoring Committee (BIMC) was to drive the broadband infrastructure licensing and deployment. He said that the licensing of the six Infracos was to ensure that they provide IP fiber Optic capacity, to all the 774 LGAs of the federation on an open access, price regulated basis, with a 10 Gbps Point of Access (PoA) capacity in each local government of the federation. He revealed that broadband can reduce poverty and inequality, help ensure access to health and education, help to mitigate climate change, promote peace and international cooperation, and ensure sustainable development in the decades to come. He called on government at all levels to curtail the issues of multiple taxation and regulation right of way issues as well as timely and simplified approval processes for site acquisition and harmonised right of way charges in the industry.
