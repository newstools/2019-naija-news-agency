Milwaukee Bucks power forward, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Nigerian descent was honoured as the Most Valuable Player of the recently concluded basketball season at an award ceremony last night. The NBA Awards ceremony which held at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California was hosted by Hall of Famer, Shaquille O’Neal. This is Giannis’ first MVP NBA nomination and win ever. It also serves as some form of compensation after his team lost the Eastern Conference Finals to the Toronto Raptors. He was also nominated as the NBA’s most defensive player of the year. Giannis Antetokounmpo is 6 feet 11 inches, 242 pounds and is extremely athletic leading to his being named the ‘Greek freak’. He is the first Greek NBA All-star and he joins Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only Milwaukee Bucks players to ever earn MVP honors. While giving his heartfelt speech, he thanked his teammates, coach, and his father who had died of a heart attack in 2017. His coach, Mike Budenholzer, also won the NBA Coach of the Year award.
