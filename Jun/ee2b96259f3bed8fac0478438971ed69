 Bill Cosby is serving three to 10 years in a Pennsylvania state prison for drugging and sexually assaulting Constand at his home 15 years ago, as his sentence began last year.

His wife; Camille, also said; “America will be great when it fulfils the last four words of the revered Pledge of Allegiance… ‘and justice for all.’ “ Follow us on Instagram and Twitter for updates.
