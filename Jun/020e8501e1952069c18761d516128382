 DMW star, Peruzzi have been reported to have allegedly slapped and assaulted a popular social media influencer who goes by the nane of The Pamilerin. According to an eye witness, she said the reason Peruzzi allegedly slapped the influencer is as a result of an old tweet the influencer published as far back as January of this year which didn’t sit so well with the DMW star. The witness also reported that apart from the slap The Pamilerin received, he was also assaulted with Peruzzi allegedly threatening him. However, since the incident happened, Twitter has gone wild with almost everyone who seems to have come across the story condemning Peruzzi’s act as well as slam him for reasons even beyond the matter on ground. Today I saw the worst form of human Stupidity and yes I said Stupidity because there isnâ€™t any way to describe the events of today So @peruzzi_vibes Assaulted @thepamilerin in the worst manner. His bouncers held @thepamilerin while he slapped him for something as stupid as a tweet he posted in January ????? Like guys, where did we loose our way? Who gave an artist the right to assault a fellow individual over an opinion that was aired? You call yourself a leader to the younger generation and is this what you preach? And Using threatening words like â€œiâ€™ll kill youâ€�…..â€�Iâ€™ll destroy youâ€� ??????????????????????????? I am really pained by this act. What happened to conversations? And peaceful resolve? If we all went around slapping, assaulting and beating up individuals that say/write things about us, wonâ€™t we be a country of Barbarians?????????? Itâ€™s at points like this the saying â€˜THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORDâ€™ I call on every media outlet to say no to violence, Celebrity Status doesnâ€™t Give you a GOD COMPLEX! He deserves to be called to order and made to face the arm of the law. A crime is a crime and no one is above the law ………………….. @tundeednut @instablog9ja @thepamilerin @walenut @kingpexxie @denrele_edun @ruggedybaba @krakstv @olorisupergal @tatafonaijanews @lindaikejiblogofficial @the_commentsection @mayornaijablog #stopviolence #violence #trend #news #nigerianentertainment #music #lagos #nigeria #naija #davido #hkn A post shared by  melvina oduah (@vinavina01) on Jun 9, 2019 at 11:25am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js The post Peruzzi Reportedly Slaps Social Media Influencer, Pamilerin As Trouble Arose appeared first on tooXclusive.
