One of partners&rsquo; activities includes improved malaria commodity utilization and improved reporting from the health facilities, through effective and efficient HMIS and LMIS data triangulation, and the test positivity rates (TPR) reported from the routine health facility data through the NHMIS.Theoretically, HMIS and LMIS data should match; however, there are different reasons those numbers do not match. It has however become imperative to compare them, to see what the differences and the magnitude of these differences are, identify the root causes and to take specific actions that will help address the root causes and improve data quality.Comparing both data systems has been proposed by relevant stakeholders as a solution to many of these challenges. In addition, the test positivity rates (TPR) reported from the routine health facility data through the NHMIS have been persistently high ranging from 60% to 80% between Jan and Dec 2018. These persistently high TPRs, despite the numerous malaria interventions, raise questions regarding the true test positivity rate, hence the need to better understand health care workers&rsquo; practices in the management of fever cases at the health facilities.MSH will be supporting this activity across 13 Global Fund supported states namely; Adamawa, Delta, Gombe, Jigawa, Niger, Kaduna, Kano, Kwara, Katsina, Ogun, Osun, Taraba and Yobe states.Specific ResponsibilitiesAnalyze the submitted triangulation data with MSH teamTo develop a comprehensive technical report detailing the findings of the triangulation&nbsp; in conjunction with MSH and other partners.Any other tasks that maybe required in relation to the activity&nbsp; Apply at https://ngcareers.com/job/2019-06/consultant-i-at-the-management-sciences-for-health-msh-595/ Source: NG Career
