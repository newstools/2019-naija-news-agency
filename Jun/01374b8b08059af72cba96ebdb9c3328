 Callum Hudson-Odoi is keen to get ‘assurances’ over his amount of playing time next season asÂ ChelseaÂ look to tie the star to a new deal. WithÂ Eden HazardÂ leaving in a Â£130million deal toÂ Real MadridÂ this summer, Hudson-Odoi will look to take the Belgian’s spot in the starting side. The teenager,Â according to the Sun, is ‘playing hardball’ in negotiations as he looks to ensure his game-time increases significantly for next season. Hudson-Odoi began to come into his own at the end of the season and had forced himself into both the Chelsea and England teams. He scored five goals during this late flurry before rupturing his Achilles in April against Burnley. Bayern Munich were particularly keen on the player in January but saw a number of significant bids knocked back by the Premier League side. Hudson-Odoi was so frustrated at the time that he handed in a transfer request and found himself watching from the stands says later when Chelsea were torn to pieces away at Bournemouth. The teenager has one year left to run on his contract and the club will be reluctant to lose such a talented young player on a free next summer. Christian Pulisic will arrive from Borussia Dortmund this summer and provides competition for Hudson-Odoi in wide areas. Bayern were keen to make him their new No 10 as the German champions look to find young talent like Dortmund did when they picked up Jadon Sancho from Manchester City.
