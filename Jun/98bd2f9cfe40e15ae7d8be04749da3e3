 The Debt Management Office has stated that the impact of the proposed limitation of commercial banksâ€™ access to government securities on the market will depend on the actual mechanism provided by the CBN. Mr Oladele Afolabi, the Director, Portfolio Management Department, Debt Management Office (DMO), said this in an interview with our correspondent yesterday in Abuja. He said that the Federal Government bond market had developed over the years from the initial period when banks were the dominant investors to the present situation where there were now other categories of investors. â€œFor instance, how would â€˜Government Securitiesâ€™ be defined? Would this include the Open Market Operations (OMO) Bills being issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)? â€œThe specifics of the mechanism would determine the impact on the marketâ€�, he said. He, however, assured that the limitation will not affect the market or discourage investors. Afolabi noted that the new categories included the pension funds, asset managers and foreign investors, all with significantly higher levels of participation than before. The Director added that the DMO had been working with other stakeholders to encourage higher level of issuances by private sector organisations and the Federal Government granted tax waivers in that regard. â€œThis is a sign of maturity of the Federal Government bond market and we expect to continue to diversify the investor base for government securities particularly with new instruments such as the Sukuk, Savings Bond and Green Bond. He said they were attracting new investors to the market. Afolabi explained that making funds available to the private sector was also the focus of the Federal Government as the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) expected the private sector to play a major role in the countryâ€™s development. According to him, the DMOâ€™s initiatives in the bond market are not just for the Federal Governmentâ€™s borrowing, but to also create a market for long term capital for other categories of issuers, such as sub-nationals and corporates. â€œThe current Debt Management Strategy, which has shifted more of the Federal Governmentâ€™s borrowing to external sources, is to create borrowing space for the private sector in the domestic market. â€œBetween 2017 and 2018, the Federal Government repaid over N1 trillion of Nigerian Treasury Bills (NTBs), to make loanable funds available to private sector borrowers and also lower interest rates in the market. â€œThis saw the rates for NTBs dropping from about 18.5 per cent in 2017 to between 10 to 11 per cent in 2018.â€� The post Banksâ€™ Access To Govt Securities Depends On CBN Mechanisms â€“ DMO Source: Independent
