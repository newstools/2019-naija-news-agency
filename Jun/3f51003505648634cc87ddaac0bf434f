  All in all, it was a quiet week, and no one was up to much trouble. Here’s what went down. Nigerians Were Not Happy with World Cup Commentator Because we like to be consistent, we’ll use the proper word: Nigerians harassedÂ Jenny Taft, the commentator who oversaw the Nigeria Vs. France Women’s World Cup match. It looked like Nigeria was going to get away with a draw, the women defending bravely. But that was until the 79th minute, when France was awarded a penalty. (VAR did ojoro. Yes, we said it.) After our young and brave goalkeeperÂ Chiamaka Nnadozie saved the penalty, the referee showed her a yellow card, saying she flouted some bogus rule (can you tell we’re pained?). Anyway, what people found the most upsetting was what the commentator was saying. And because they could not do anything about the results of the game, they decided to take out their frustrations on her: You messed with the wrong set of people! We won’t let you off easily! I don’t blame you sha! You can’t do any better. When God requested for heads to insert brains you submitted your trailer park called mouth/teeth. If broken into pieces it will roof a bungalow!

Anyway, thank God for video oo. In one of the gubernatorial debates in the rup-up to the elections, Sanwo-Olu had promised to tackle the Apapa traffic within the first 100 days. Even after he was elected, while speaking during an interactive session with his classmates at the Executive Master of Business Administration class, University of Lagos, 1998/2000 set, he said he’d clear the gridlock within 60 days. Now? Our governor has said he didn’t promise to clear the traffic. He said he promised to “review” it. eL Oh eL… Speaking to State House correspondents in Abuja, he said: They said that I mentioned during the campaign train that I was going to clear it in 60 days. […] What I said was that in 60 days we would review what was done but that does not take the fact that even if people give you dateline, itâ€™s because they want you to do well and they want you to be able to be accountable for those datelines. Let’s just thank God for life. 19/5/2019: Iâ€™ll end Apapa gridlock within my first 60 days in office – Sanwo-Olu 18/6/2019: I never promised to fix Apapa gridlock in 60 days – Sanwo-Olu pic.twitter.com/UfUU9Eytt1 â€” HEADmaster (@Mr_Hardey) June 18, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js This was Sanwo-Olu on national TV, posturing and grandstanding about solving the Apapa gridlock challenge.
