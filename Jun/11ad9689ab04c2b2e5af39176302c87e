 NGOZI UMA Like many outdated traditions from the Old Testament practiced by the church of old, celebration of harvest in todayâ€™s churches seems to have lost its relevance. Many believe the old practice is not relevant in Christendom since Jesus Christ never mentioned it in the New Testament while some faulted it based on the advent of new technology and industrialisation, which have taken many people away from the traditional farming, with the attendant loss of farm produce. Yet some people are of the view that the way some orthodox churches celebrate harvest is not Biblical. According to them, the bazaar that followed the celebration, where the items from harvest are sold to the highest bidders, gave room to unhealthy competition among members, and therefore at variance with the teachings of Christ. According to the scripture, harvest is celebrated with first fruit of the crops one sows in his field. Similarly, one can say that harvest is the celebration of ingathering at the end of the year. But to many, each day that we earn a paycheck, we experience harvest. Each time we receive love from our family and those in our lives, we experience harvest. Each time we experience the closeness of God in a way that fills us spiritually, we experience harvest. Any time we are filled, we experience harvest. Harvest then, according to them, should not be seen as something that we experience once a year, but something that we experience on a daily basis. Sunday INDEPENDENT spoke to pastors on why many churches do not celebrate harvest, and this is what they have to say: Rev. (Dr) Sam Anya, presiding pastor of The United Church Of Christ (Fountain Of Peace) Ijaiye, said harvest originated from the Old Testament and many Pentecostal churches today have different doctrines, hence their doctrines determine the kind of programmes they engaged in. â€œThere are so many believes about the issue of harvest, and you know harvest is a doctrine of the Old Testament. Churches have different doctrines and orientations, which means that the doctrine which a church adopted goes a long way to determine their activities and programme. â€œYou will discover that during the time of the Old Testament, agriculture was the main stay of economy of the people and that was the reason people brought the proceeds of their harvest for sacrifice and thanksgiving to the house of God. But now itâ€™s different as technology has taken over and brought changes and innovations. â€œBut in my local church, even though we are a Pentecostal church, we still observe harvest. Like they said, change is constant. Most of the Pentecostal churches have a New Testament orientation on doctrines and teachings, and when you look at the New Testament, the issue of harvest was not mentioned.â€� Speaking on the essence of harvest, he said, â€œFrom the Old Testament, people had to bring part of what they harvested to the house of God to appreciate Him for the harvest season, just as the Igboâ€™s celebrate New Yam festivals. â€œBut from religious angle, in each harvest season, the ingathering of farm produce, people were expected to come to the presence of God to appreciate Him with some of the things they harvested, to thank God for bountiful harvest. â€œToday, so many of us are not into agriculture, that is why many churches are not using that style of harvest, they are using what is in vogue (money and materials) to do Thanksgiving.â€� The cleric continued, â€œFirst fruit and harvest are not the same, but both are used to show an appreciation to God, in form of thanksgiving. Harvest is purely used to appreciate God for a bountiful harvest, but first fruit is a way of honoring God with the first things you gather from your work, which could be your first earning, or profit from what you do for a living, knowing that without Him we can do nothing. â€œWe are in the dispensation of grace, whichever way anybody or a church chooses to appreciate God, they are at liberty to do so.â€� Pastor Isaac Ogunrinola of The Apostolic Church, Apapa Area in his view said, harvest is a commandment of God to the children of Israel, but seems to be irrelevant as Jesus never mentioned it in the New Testament. â€œIn the Old Testament God commanded the Israelites to celebrate harvest with their first fruit that is where the orthodox churches got the orientation of observing harvest. â€œBut in the New Testament the Bible was silent about harvest, I think that is why Pentecostal churches do not celebrate harvest. In my church, the Apostolic church, we donâ€™t observe harvest, but instead of harvest, churches have adopted another programme, like in rural areas, they call it church expansion offering.â€� Ogunrinola faulted the way many orthodox churches conduct their harvests and the bazaars that follow, saying it is often marked with unhealthy competition among members. â€œIn some orthodox churches, after the harvest, there would be bazaar, where people compete with each other to show off wealth and the highest bidder gets the item. â€œThat is not Biblical, that is not the purpose of harvest. The purpose is to thank God for His provision. Many Pentecostal churches today donâ€™t celebrate harvest, rather we do thanksgiving in appreciation of what God has done for us in the course of the year,â€� he said. Speaking further, he said, â€œHarvest and tithing are Godâ€™s commandment, harvest is a commandment of God from the Old Testament. God told His people to bring out of their harvest to His house and tithing on the other hand was also Godâ€™s commandment, but you will discover that Jesus never said anything about harvest, but He mentioned tithing in the New Testament.â€� Continuing, â€œIf the Old Testament does not have challenges, there wonâ€™t be room for the New Testament. The purpose of the New Testament is to renew the covenant, and Jesus Christ came to renew the covenant. â€œIn Luke 22: 20, after the supper, he took the cup, saying, â€˜this cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for youâ€™. You can see that harvest is not really established in the New Testament. But any church that is celebrating harvest should do it in the right way and not turning the church to a business center where items from harvest are sold in a bazaar, thereby giving room to unhealthy competition. â€œWhen I was in the southern part of Nigeria, my local church does observe harvest, the people brought what they have before the Lord for thanksgiving but we donâ€™t sell the items gotten from the harvest, the items are given to the servants of God, the clergy will not eat it alone, they also, will give some to the widows and the less privileged among them.â€� Rev. (Dr) Paul Ndeobi, Senior pastor of Straight Gate Church, Obawale, Lagos, said there are some things the churches do which are not direct instruction from the Bible, and harvest is one of them. â€œThere are certain things God allows the church to do that may not be direct command from the scripture, such as the issue of harvest. Harvest is a way through which churches raise fund for their projects. They will bring a lot of people together to raise fund to support any of the church projects. â€œIt is a traditional festival that is done in some orthodox churches and the Pentecostals are not given to harvest as they have a way they raise fund for any church project. â€œIt appears that the orthodox churches do harvest once in a year which makes some of their projects to take longer period to complete.â€� Ndeobi is of the view that the Pentecostal style of raising funds for church projects is more efficient and faster than orthodox style of harvest. â€œBut today some orthodox churches are beginning to adopt the style used by Pentecostal churches to raise fund, which is faster and more effective. We can see gigantic projects done by the Pentecostal and Evangelical churches. â€œYou can see that some orthodox churches take, like 30 years to build a cathedral that ordinarily would take a Pentecostal church few years to build,â€� he said. He added, â€œIt is not scripturally commanded that we should celebrate harvest and Jesus Christ never commanded us to do it. There are two sacraments in the Bible that Jesus commanded us to do, that is taking of communion and the water baptism. â€œThanking God with your first fruit in form of harvest is to appreciate God, it is not expressly commanded, if it was universally commanded there would have been uniformity in practice. Harvest is a voluntary act of men trying to thank God,â€� Rev. (Dr) Prince Obed Ezeonye, Senior Pastor of Excellent Glory Christian Centre, Iju, Lagos, said that the body of Christ still observes harvest but celebrates it differently. â€œThere are changes in the body of Christ, harvest was well celebrated in the early church but today it seems that many churches donâ€™t observe it because of changes. The church has to move with time. â€œHarvest is common with the orthodox churches but the new generational churches are going beyond the level of orthodox churches. In Exodus, chapter 34 verses 22, we were told of the feast of ingathering and in the feast of ingathering, God instructed the children of Israel to appear before him thrice in a year. The feast of ingathering takes place at the end of the year. â€œSome Pentecostal churches still observe quarterly thanksgiving, some are doing monthly thanksgiving and this is likened to the feast of ingathering. It is just that the orthodox churches do it at the end of the year,â€� he said. Continuing, â€œIt is not that harvest is on extinction in the body of Christ, it is being celebrated by the new generation churches in different ways like the orthodox having it at the end of the year. Some Pentecostal churches observe monthly thanksgiving while some are having it quarterly, and others celebrate it at the end of the year. â€œI think it is an issue of nomenclature. The orthodox call it harvest while the new generation churches call it thanksgiving which they have segmented into monthly, quarterly and end of the year thanksgiving.â€� The post Harvest Is It Scripturally Commanded?
