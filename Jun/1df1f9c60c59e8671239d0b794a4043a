 Naira Marley has been released from custody almost two weeks since he was awarded bail by the Justice who presided over his bail hearing at the Federal high court, Ikoyi. Marlians have now been thrown into a jubilant mood as the singer finally gets home since he was arrested last month in connection with internet fraud. Prior to the release of the singer, there were rumours which flew around on the internet that there wasn’t any government official willing to stand as a surety for the singer due to his criminal records which resulted in the singer’s release being delayed. However, his management debunked the rumour saying it was false as the only reason his release was delayed was because the EFCC and the court were unable to promptly process the final steps of his release. All of these are not important anymore as the singer now regains freedom after almost a month in the ‘wilderness.’ #NairaMarley finally out on bail A post shared by  Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) on Jun 14, 2019 at 9:34am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js The post Breaking!!!
