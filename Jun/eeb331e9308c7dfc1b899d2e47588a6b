 Atletico Madrid midfielder Rodri has informed the club he wishes to leave with Manchester City his preferred destination. The 22-year-old had asked for time to consider his future with City and Bayern Munich willing to activate his Â£62.5million buy-out clause while Atletico had offered a new contract. Bayern Munich had made a concerted play for Rodri’s signature and were considered City’s main rivals but Rodri is understood to have informed club president Angel Gil Marin of his preference to link up with Pep Guardiola on Monday. Barcelona had also made a late enquiry for the Spain international. Rodri made 47 Atletico appearances during the 2018-19 campaign, scoring three goals and providing one assist. The Madrid-born defensive midfielder already has two medals to his name, winning the European Championships with Spain under-19s and the UEFA Super Cup in his first game as an Atletico player in August 2018. Atleti’s No 14 impressed during a 4-2 win against city rivals Real in Tallinn. Rodri registered 84 appearances for Villarreal before making a Â£22m move to join Diego Simeone’s side in May 2018.
