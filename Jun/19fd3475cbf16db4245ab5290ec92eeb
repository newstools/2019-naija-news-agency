 Veteran Nollywood actress Clarion Chukwura is declaring that “Jesus Christ is the ultimate,” sharing her testimony of salvation. “As an Actress, I played the role of the B**h and life was all about Glamour and Glitz, and though I was the Humanitarian, I didn’t realise that with CHRIST there are no half measures,” she wrote in an Instagram post. She continued: “But, Today, HE has saved me – John 3 : 16 and like the Apostle Paul – Romans 1 : 16 and I will Glorify His Name because HE has empowered me for others to be saved – Acts 1 : 8. Jesus Christ is the ULTIMATE…do you know HIM? Are you saved? Do you have a one on one relationship with Jesus Christ today like i do? If so, what is your Testimony?” The post Clarion Chukwura shares Testimony of Salvation: “Jesus Christ is the ultimate” appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world. Read today!.
