 Earlier this month, the Syrian state-run broadcaster reported that the country’s air defence confronted terrorists’ unmanned flying vehicles near a helipad in Jubb Ramlah village in Hama province. The Syrian Army has downed a UAV belonging to terrorists near the Hama military base, Syrian state TV reported on Saturday. There’s no information on whether the drone possessed any type of armament. Terrorists from Nusra Front* terrorist group construct drones capable of carrying explosive devices with strike elements. Last month, terrorists increased the frequency of attacks on the Syrian provinces of Hama, Aleppo and Latakia. They have also been attempting attacks on Syrian army positions in the region. Syrian forces are targeting Nusra Front terrorist group depots, artillery positions and observation posts.
