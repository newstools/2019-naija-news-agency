 Benin – Major General Charles Airiavbere (Rtd) on Wednesday blamed Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki for the crisis rocking the state House of Assembly, saying that the governor’s inability to proclaim the assembly properly shows that he has lost control of the State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC). This was contained in a statement the retired army general issued in Benin where he declared that the governor should not exonerate himself from the current Edo state Assembly imbroglio. According to him, the unfolding drama in Edo State where the governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki failed to send the letter to the Clerk of the house for the formal inauguration of the State assembly is an indication that he has lost control of the APC in the state. “This is all the more so considering the fact that all the 24 member-elect contested and were elected by Edo people to the State Assembly, on the platform of the APC, a party which the governor supposedly presides over as Leader. “As it stands now, the governor still has a lifeline to be relevant and this is by doing the needful, which in clear terms is sending the proclamation letter for the inauguration of the elected members of the Edo State Assembly.” The post Obaseki Lost Control Of Edo APC, Says General Airiavbere  Source: Independent
