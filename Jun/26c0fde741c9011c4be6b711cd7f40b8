 Lagos –Â Worried by the loss of lives and properties as a result of insurgency in the Northeast and related crimes in other parts of Nigeria, clerics have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to give top priority to addressing the issues of insecurity and economic hardship in his second term in office. According to the global terrorism index released in December 2018, Nigeria was ranked third position in terrorism, which shows that the country comes immediately after Iraq and Afghanistan. In recent times, attacks by Fulani herdsmen have become the most potent threat to national security and states such as Benue, Niger, Taraba, Kaduna, Plateau, Kogi, Edo, Ogun, Kwara, Oyo, Osun, Ekiti, among others, were not spared. Most recently, kidnapping and banditry have become the order of the day as men, women, young, old, rich, poor and even security personnel are kidnapped for ransom. Christian clerics in separate interviews with Sunday INDEPENDENT advised President Buhari to ensure that all his campaign promises are fulfilled, especially securing the lives of Nigerians. Bishop Emmah Isong, National Publicity Secretary of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), said he expects the President to focus more on the security of lives and properties of Nigerians. He added that the President should strive to provide basic infrastructure to grow the economy so that there will no more hunger and suicide in the land. Mathew Oluyemi, a Pastor in a Pentecostal church in Lagos, said he hopes the President will get it right in his second coming. â€œIn my perspective, it is like the government has lost control over the security of this country and people are losing hope. So, what I am expecting from PMB is to revisit the state of insecurity in Nigeria,â€� he stated. On the rumour of Islamisation of Nigeria, Oluyemi said he expects his aides and close associates to tell him the truth that any attempt toÂ  Islamise Nigeria might be the end of the journey. â€œReligion has a lot of role to play in governance, but governance is supposed to distance itself from religion. Anything that is not going to bring any progress to ordinary man on the street is not supposed to be something that the government will think about. â€œSo, I will expect that he will be able to think twice if it is true that his government is planning to Islamise the nation. I would rather expect him to have a rethink.â€� He lauded the performance of the President on the issue of anti-corruption crusade. â€œI will also want him to continue because it is like he is a blunt person, though there are still some accusations that he shields some people that are still very close to him, especially those members of his party and even members of his kitchen cabinet. â€œHe should be able to be the first President that will use fire to test his neighbour to prove that he is a genuine leader that he has always claim to be. He should continue his anti-corruption agenda and what a lay man on the street will want to hear is employment. Once the area of employment is not given priority, there is still going to be a very serious problem in the country,â€� he added. Pastor Oluyemi further stated that President Buhari should start thinking about how an average youth will be employed and he should also start thinking about how agriculture will be given priority in such a way that there will be enough food in the country. â€œI believe that if all these things are taken into consideration, it is going to have a good run in his second term,â€� he added. Speaking on the continued detention of Leah Sharibu, he noted that it is unfortunate that she is still in captivity. â€œWe donâ€™t even know if she is still alive. What if we wake up tomorrow and we discover that Leah Sharibu is dead; what will be the future of this country? Forget about religion now. That girl has become a star of this generation; that girl has stood her ground against all molestations, but who can tell us the current status of Leah Sharibu? What will make all Nigerians to be happy as we just entered the month of June is to hear that President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s government has been able to ensure that she is released, no matter what it is going to cost this country. As long as that girl is still in captivity, it is going to be a terrible stigma on the government of PMB,â€� he added. Pastor James Ajibike of Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) Garment of Glory, Ojodu, in his view, said the expectations of the masses are so high because the nation needs a deliverer and that the country has suffered a lot in the hands of political saboteurs. He said the President needs to ensure great changes in all facets and to realise such, he needs to put God first and to genuinely seek for Godâ€™s guidance, adding that Buhari should not allow tribalism, nepotism and regionalism to dominate his activities. In his view, Prophet Omoniyi Akindele of the Pillar of Truth Spiritual Church, Cherubim and Seraphim, said he expects the President to fulfill all his campaign promises and also concentrate more on creating job opportunities for the youth to reduce crimes in the country. He stressed that Buhari should also look into the issue of electricity and make sure the prepaid meters are evenly distributed, adding that he should also look into pensionersâ€™ issue and make sure they are paid as at when due. Akindele also advised that security personnel should be well taken care of so that they would do their work diligently and not accept bribes, stressing that anyone caught in the act of corruption among them should be dismissed and jailed to serve as a deterrent to others. Pastor Mike Ehiedu, Senior Pastor, Foursquare Gospel Church, Maya, Ikorodu, said that there are lot to be done in the area of safety of lives and properties, putting an end to Boko Haram, Fulani terrorists, fixing the economy, good education system in public schools, unemployment, among others. Pastor Ehiedu also said that security of lives and properties is a core responsibility of government and that the best Nigerians can do is to be vigilant and keep surveillance at top notch. He added that churches should educate their congregants on security consciousness. Pastor Newman Ogezi of One Foundation Ministries International, Ago Palace Way, Okota, Lagos, said the President must rise up to the security challenges in the country and that Nigerians would want PMB to address the security situation of this country in his second term. He charged him to replace all security chiefs immediately and replace them with capable ones, adding that in replacing the old security chiefs, he should not allow ethnicity and religious bias to override his decision. â€œThe present service chiefsâ€™ composition is one-sided and it gives room for suspicion that he has a hidden Islamisation agenda as being expressed in many quarters by Christian leaders among who are Generals Olusegun Obasanjo and Theophilus Danjuma,â€� he stressed. He said though there are efforts being made to put an end to insurgency, the desired peace in that regards has not been seen.Â  Â â€œWe are witnessing pockets of banditry, kidnappings, killings and unrests that seem to be on the increase in places that they were minimal before now. Attacks by Fulani herdsmen have become the most potent threat to national security in the last couple of years,â€� Ogezi said. Ogezi further stated that the President must be proactive and he should act quickly and decisively as his military training requires. Pastor Ayodeji Olulani, a Minister and the Executive Director of Christian and Citizensâ€™ Empowerment Foundation, said Nigerians hope that this time around that Buhari-led administration will stop giving excuses for its poor performance. He said Nigerians expect better performance during the 2019 to 2023 period and that they expect policies and developments that will make life easier for them. â€œWe want policies that will translate into Nigeria being removed from poverty headquarters of the world, and the most risky place to live and train children. Also, any administration that pays lip-service to the plight of youths is sitting on a time-bomb that will eventually consume it,â€� he noted. He further stated that the issue of corruption must be adequately addressed, as corruption is majorly at the root of under-development in developing countries, including Nigeria, adding that resources for developmental purposes are cornered by the political elites, public officers and their cronies. â€œWe hope with our support, prayers commitment and the political will to succeed, this second coming will be better than the first coming of President Buhari administration,â€� he said. Bishop Emmanuel Udah, Presiding Bishop of Peace andÂ  Joy International Ministry, Akowonjo, Lagos, however, said, â€œSincerely, I donâ€™t really expect much from him in this new term. Doing so is too much a risk on oneâ€™s blood pressure. If he proves me wrong by performing beyond my expectations, I will count it as bonus blessings. I am not exactly clear on his blueprint in this new term for improvement on the past four years. â€œHis style of governance this last four years was not different from when he was military Head of State; except that this time, he was constrained by the constitution. â€œI am afraid that the new term will not herald any revolutionary changes. It may even turn out to be ideologically uneventful and nothing distinct from the past four. He doesnâ€™t communicate much to have held him to anything meaningful. When he does communicate, his words are not reassuring. As far back as March this year, for instance, just after his re-election, he already forecasted â€˜tougher times ahead.â€� He added, â€œI hope we are not going to drift through the next four years with blame-games like the last four was almost completely wasted, blaming his predecessors and the Legislature. I expect him to get down to business this time and deliver on those points for which power was reposed on him the second time. He should seek capable hands that will help him meet the yearnings of the populace.â€� On securing places of worship, Isong said that churches have no plans or strategies to protect themselves butÂ  constantly pray that God should cause confusion in the camp of the enemies so that they will not be able to perform their enterprise. On his part, Oluyemi stated that it is only God that secures. He noted that churches too are sensitive to the security status of the country, adding that a lot of churches have devised means to ensure members of the congregation are secure. â€œEspecially in the childrenâ€™s church, so many churches have devised means of giving out tags to parents which if you do not have that tag, you will not be able to pick your children. â€œWe also teach morals; we teach these children on how to be security conscious. So, there is that alertness going on in the church today. Today, many churches employ the services of security operatives, especially police to secure their members during services,â€� he said. Ajibike stated that it is high time that all the churches under the control of the Living God arise to intercessory prayers to avert the activities of the wicked insurgencies against the churches and the children of God. He quoted from the book of Psalm 127:1 â€˜Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vainâ€™ and Ephesians 6: 10 to17, â€˜put on the armour of God against the wiles of the devil.â€™ He therefore said that all the Christians should rise towards the deliverance of this nation spiritually and be law-abiding citizens by not taking law into their hands. â€œWe should endeavour to be praying for this country over the appointment of Godly leaders and to run the activities of this nation as being led by God. There is nobody that God cannot use when it is time for Him to exhibit His purpose at any given time,â€� he said. Ajibike further advised Nigerians to continue to prophecy positive things over this nation than cursing the nation because there is power in the tongue. Ehiedu said, â€œSecurity should be all-encompassing, all religious sects should be safe and freely worship. Godâ€™s church shall march on despite calculated attempts to stop us. Our weapons are our relationship with Christ, prayers and obedience to Godâ€™s instructions. Let us get on our knees and ask that God shows us what to do. â€œOur protection does not come from men but from God, but we have a part to play. For churches, this is an age of great technological innovation, there are lots of gadgets we can invest in to safeguard our places of worship.â€� Udah said that churches in vulnerable areas should put some security checks in place to secure their place of worships, stating that tough times demand tougher measures to tackle daunting problems. â€œWhere security is completely unavailable, I suggest they use underground tactics in the meantime as was practised by Christians in Communist countries,â€� he said. Ogezi noted that the body of Christ should approach the government and demand for security for the church. â€œIf it is accepted, then we can now tell them the need to have Christian soldiers to man the churches while Muslim soldiers take care of the mosques. If they refuse our proposal, we should be allowed to equip our own people as church security and that means that the government can supervise this but grant them the use of arms,â€� he said. According to Olulani, security belongs to God and if God does not protects all human security measures are in vain. â€œVigilance is our watchword; training in security awareness is one of our methods. Cooperation and liaison with security agencies is emphasised. We also believe that self-defence, in the face of unprovoked attacks, is not a sin or crime under our laws. It is a universally accepted law. Let those who derive joy in violence be put on notice,â€� he added. The post 2nd Term: Clerics Set Agenda For Buhari Source: Independent
