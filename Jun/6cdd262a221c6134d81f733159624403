 Naira Marley  has introduced a new dance style to music fans which he calls “Soapy” in ushering in his new single which he titles “Soapy” as well. The singer/rapper took to his Instagram page some hours ago to make a video of himself doing the dance moves for fans to see, so they could learn from… and then join the “Soapy” train too. The dance style is quite different from the “Zanku” style as it comes in a highly ridiculous & hilarious form. The dance would have you put your hands close to your private part and make you shake your buttocks alongside the hand like you are doing the unthinkable.   #Soapy out now #SoapyDance #InsideLife #Marlians click on the Link in my bio Prod by badboy @rexxiepondabeat A post shared by  Naira Marley (@nairamarley) on Jun 27, 2019 at 4:29pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Naira has been the most talked about Nigerian musician on social media in the past one and a half month, from his beef with Simi, his controversial proclamation regarding Yahoo Yahoo (internet fraudsters), his arrest by the EFCC, Naira Marley has been the most trending topic on social media back-to-back.
