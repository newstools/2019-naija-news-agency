 Werder Bremenâ€™s sporting director has insisted that the club have received no bids for reported Liverpool target Jiri Pavlenka. Jurgen Klopp is on the lookout for a new backup for Alisson, in case Simon Mignolet moves on in search of more regular first team football this summer. And Czech shot-stopper Pavlenka is said to be firmly on his radar, after an impressive season in the Bundesliga. Pavlenka has impressed in his two seasons in Germany, leading to reports that Liverpool and Juventus â€“ who may need to replace the unsettled Mattia Perin as Wojciech Szczesnyâ€™s understudy â€“ were interested in the 27-year-old. However, according to Werder Bremenâ€™s sporting director Frank Baumann, Pavlenka is going nowhere. â€œWe plan with Pavlenka for the new season,â€� he told Weser-Kurier. â€œThere is no offer from Juventus or Liverpool for Jiri Pavlenka.â€� Pavlenka is under contract with Bremen until 2021, having penned an extension last summer. It was recently claimed that Liverpool would offer Loris Karius the other way in the negotiations, but there appears to be no agreement yet.
