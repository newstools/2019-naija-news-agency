 Runtown experienced probably the most unthinkable fan gesture he would ever get yesterday as he was faced with one of the first steps to becoming a husband. The talented singer who recently released a brilliant E.P; “Tradition” which has been doing absolutely brilliantly, had a performance in Lagos yesterday night in which he had possibly the biggest amusement of his life. The singer while he was performing soulfully to the well entertained audience, had a young woman come out of the crowd to propose to him with a ring. The singer who was surprised and overwhelmed at the same time, showed a receptive reaction to the gesture from the fan as he accepted the ring and posted it afterwards on his Instagram with a caption that projects appreciation for the lady’s move. Lady proposed to Runtown last night while he was performing on stage.
