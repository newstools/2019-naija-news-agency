An aggrieved lady has dragged her boyfriend on Facebook after he claimed heâ€™s single and is in need of a room to rent. He posted in the Adelaide Rental Property Facebook page on Monday in an effort to find a room. Quoteâ€˜Looking for a room in northern suburbs. I work full time, and have great references. Iâ€™m single and Iâ€™m drug/alcohol free. Willing to pay up to 200 a week (bills included),â€™ he wrote. Within 20 minutes, his girlfriend came across the post and slammed him for looking for a new room and for saying he was single.
Quoteâ€˜Ummm what the actual f*** babe?! Since when were u single… ~
