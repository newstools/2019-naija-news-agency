 Nigerian popstar, Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo ‘Dbanj’ has explained how manages to joggle between a tight work schedule and his marital responsibilities. In a recent chat with Vanguard, the â€˜Fall in Loveâ€™ crooner explained how he has been able to successfully achieve this feat saying, â€œItâ€™s been very hard but the truth is one just has to understand what he/she is doing’. He went on to say, ‘when you see the actors or footballers in the club, theyâ€™re just normal people, but when the footballers put on their jersey and get on the field, theyâ€™re different people entirely. I was with Obafemi Martins in the club recently and he was just a normal person but when he wears the jersey, heâ€™s a different person. So like I said, one just needs to understand what you do. As an entertainment person, itâ€™s part of me. When I wear my costume as Dâ€™banj, I get to entertain my people but then Iâ€™ve my privacy and if you check it properly for the last decade, even if Iâ€™m out there I keep my private life very private. If you know how to strike a balance and then God blesses you with the right wife that can understand then youâ€™re goodâ€�, he said. Speaking further, he revealed the secret behind his ability to successfully stay relevant on the Nigerian music scene for more than a decade. â€œI really donâ€™t know, I just do what I do. But I think itâ€™s just by doing what I know how to do best and being true to myself, being original. Also, believing in God and touching base with your foundation, where youâ€™re coming from. For a very long time Iâ€™ve always tried to understand my calling, I think thatâ€™s one thing that has helped me to get to this level and itâ€™s been an interesting ride.â€� The post Dbanj reveals how he’s managed to strike balance between music and marriage Source: 36Ng
