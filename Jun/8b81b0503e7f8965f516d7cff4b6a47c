 Russian military had to leave the military base in the village of Tal Salba in the North of the Syrian Hama province after it was shelled by militants from the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (former Jabhat al-Nusra), reports Al-Masdar News, According to Uawire.org. The militants attacked the Russian troops and, during their offensive, they also managed to capture several combat positions previously controlled by the Syrian army. According to the report, the massive artillery shelling of Tal Salba was only interrupted by powerful air strikes which were carried out by Russian aircraft. A significant number of Russians troops are stationed in the cities Mharda and Al-Suqaylabiyah. However, it is unlikely that they will leave these cities with significant civilian population.
