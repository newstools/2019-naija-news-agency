 The Bournemouth chief executive, Neill Blake, has issued an update on Arsenal transfer targetÂ Ryan Fraser’sÂ future. Following an impressive Premier League campaign in which he scored seven goals and weighed in with 14 assists, the Scotland international is very much on the radar of Gunners head coach Unai Emery as he looks to bolster his wide options this summer. In an interview with Scotsman, Fraser admitted his Â£30m price-tag was too high and that would rule the Gunners out of the running asÂ football.londonÂ understands they would look to do a deal for Â£10m less. With just a year left on his contract at the Vitality Stadium there has been suggestions that the winger has no intentions to sign a new contract, thus forcing the Cherries’ hands to sell this summer or risk losing him for free. However, amid claims thatÂ FraserÂ isn’t keen on a new deal, the Bournemouth chief has addressed the speculation and insisted an offer is still on the table after the 25-year-old requested talks be put on hold at the beginning of the 2018/2019 season. “Much has been written and spoken about the future of Ryan Fraser, as his contract with AFC Bournemouth heads into its final 12 months,” Blake said in a statement via the club’sÂ official websiteÂ . “As is the clubâ€™s policy, details regarding contract negotiations or transfer activity are kept confidential and do not enter the public domain. “However, following some recent reports I felt it was imperative to speak publicly and provide balanced clarity on the situation. The offer of a new long-term contract has been on the table for Ryan for some time. “In September 2018, at the request of Ryanâ€™s representative, negotiations were paused to allow the player to focus entirely on his football. “He went on to have an outstanding season, with seven goals and 13 assists helping the club secure a fifth successive season of Premier League football. “During that time, I have been â€“ and continue to be â€“ in regular dialogue with Ryanâ€™s representative, and have made it clear to both him and the player that our contract offer remains on the table. “Quite simply, Ryan is a fantastic player and an integral part of our squad. We look forward to welcoming Ryan back to us next month after a well-earned break, upon which he can focus on having another standout season for AFC Bournemouth.” The post Bournemouth Chief Issues Statement Regarding Ryan Fraser’s Future Amid Arsenal Links Source: Independent
