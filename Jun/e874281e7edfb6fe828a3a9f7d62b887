 LAGOS –Â After enduring the general elections period with mixed trading reactions, the mood in Nigeriaâ€™s stock market suggests that it is anxiously waiting for governmentâ€™s policy stimulus as it approaches the end of the first half of the year. Investigation by DAILY INDEPENDENT revealed that the atmosphere in the country is still not friendly to the economy because of lack of policy direction by the fiscal authority. Ambrose Omorodion, the Chief Operating Officer Iinvestdata, said governmentâ€™s body language has suggested that it is not ready to tackle the debilitating lukewarm attitude of the last four years. His words: â€œMarket cannot go anywhere because you cannot separate the economy from government. Government runs the economy. They are the ones that give the direction the economy and the stock market will go. â€œSince budget has been passed and accented to by the president, we expect the government to give us ministers to start implementing the budget. Permanent secretaries cannot implement the budget until when ministers are appointed. This is slowing down the economy and it is not good for the stock marketâ€�. To Cyril Ampka, an Abuja based economist, he said the Nigerian Stock market like other stock markets across the globe rely on government policy stimulus for it to work for the overall interest of the economy. â€œI donâ€™t know any stock market that is an island of its own without necessary impetus from the government of that country. There is no time for this administration to waste anymore. If not for the steps taken by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) the economy would have been in comatose by now. â€œThe CBNâ€™s bravery in restricting some 43 items from forex was outstanding. If you look at it very well you will see that it was not the duty of the CBN to ban some items from being imported into the country but it took the decision to save local manufacturing. â€œI think this government should wake up and take the bull by the horn and introduce policies that will drive the economyâ€�. Omorodion is of the opinion that technocrats should be invited to serve as ministers and not political jobbers. â€œI will advise the President to ensure that there are enough technocrats among the ministers that will implement the budget. This is the time the government should right their wrongs of the past four years but if they fail to lay strong economy that will turn round the fortune of the country then they have failed the country. â€œThe policy implementation of the government is not good enough as we saw in the last four years. If the United States of America their rates as it may likely happen in their next monetary policy meeting, then we will expect less of foreign funds into the economy and that is not going to be good for usâ€�. Reacting to statements in certain quarters that the listing of MTN Nigeria on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) is enough stimulus for the stock market to bounce back, Omorodion said the listing not at anytime a stimulus. â€œThe coming of MTN Nigeria to the market cannot give it the impetus to galvanise the economy. What the listing of MTN Nigeria has done was to improve market capitalisationâ€�, he concluded. The post Nigeriaâ€™s Stock Market Awaits Govtâ€™s Policy Stimulus Source: Independent
