 LeriQ joins forces with Skales and Teni for “No Wahala“. The Nigerian producer and songwriter after a long while returns to the music scene with a new jam. He had to combine Dr Dolor’s raving female star, Teni Makanaki with Baseline frontliner, Mr Skales just to bless this monster beat with their loving vibe and melody. LeriQ is a certified hit maker who produced most of Burna Boy’s hit records while at Aristokraft. He also had hit songs himself with assist from Wizkid, 2Baba, Burna Boy, Dammy Krane, etc. “No Wahala” is an Afro-pop record with some unique touches and elements that made it topnotch. Teni and Skales made a prefect combination.
