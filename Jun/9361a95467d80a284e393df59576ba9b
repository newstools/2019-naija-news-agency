 They are the toasts of the moment in the present political dispensation now in Lagos, being foremost Lagosians in plum political posts. One is the brand new Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, while the other is the refreshing Governor of Lagos State. Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and His Excellency, Babajide Sanwo-Olu share a common bond by way of birthdays, as they just celebrated their coming to the world days back, and they accomplished this with their new titles as Speaker and Governor respectively. Interestingly, they both hail from Lagos State, and this will not come to many as a surprise because they both came on board with very strong pedigrees. While Femi has been a formidable member of the Green Chambers for many terms, Sanwo-Olu comes in as the Governor of the City of Aquatic Splendour with very rich antecedents and is already proving pundits wrong with his mettle that he can surpass his predecessor against all odds. Their birthdays in this month of June, shortly after their swearing-in, in their respective capacities, is sure a signpost for better things to come for their constituencies and constituents so to speak. The two are celebrating their late fifties and are going the full hog to make their impacts felt where they operate as political leaders and opinion moulders. No one needs to be told of where they are coming from when it comes to delivering dividends of democracy as they have been tested, proven and trusted and confirmed as sure deliverers of these dividends.
