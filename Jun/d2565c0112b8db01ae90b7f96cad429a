 Jurgen Klopp has revealed how he teared up as Liverpoolâ€™s Champions League heroes returned home. Liverpool beat Tottenham 2-0 in Saturdayâ€™s European showpiece even thanks to an early penalty from Mohamed Salah and a late strike from Divock Origi gifting Klopp his first trophy at the club since joining in 2015. The six time champions returned home on Sunday to a rapturous celebration on the streets of Liverpool as an estimated 750,000 fans came out to welcome the club home. The team paraded the trophy from an open top bus whilst enjoying a few beers as they secured the trophy after Premier League heartbreak just a three weeks earlier. Now, Klopp has admitted how it all got a little bit too much for him. The German coach, who won the Champions League for the first time in what was his third final, said: â€œI cannot really describe it because I cried a little bit as well because itâ€™s so overwhelming what the people are doing. â€œWhen you have a direct eye contact and you see how much it means to them thatâ€™s touching to be honest. Itâ€™s brilliant. â€œThank God the weather changed in a positive direction so we are having a wonderful time here. Itâ€™s really special. â€œI donâ€™t know exactly how many people live in Liverpool but thereâ€™s not a lot of space for fans and supporters of other clubs, so itâ€™s incredible! â€œThis team is really doing so well and if you are a young kid which team would you support? â€œThere are not a lot of other options and opportunities apart from Liverpool so itâ€™s really nice to see. â€œYou see in their eyes how much it means. Itâ€™s unbelievable and itâ€™s so intense. Today, wow! Itâ€™s crazy.â€� The post Klopp Reveals What Moved Him To Tears During Champions League Parade Source: Independent
