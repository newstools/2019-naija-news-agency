Nigeria’s Super Eagles got their 2019 African Cup of Nations campaign off to winning star after beating Budundi 1-0 at the Alexendria Stadium on Saturday, June 22. It took second half substitute Odion Ighalo just four minutes after coming on to break the deadlock for the three time African champions. The 77th minute lone strike was enough to secure maximum points for coach Gernot Rohr’s side as they prepare for a tough encounter against Guinea in their second group game. However, pictures of president Muhammadu Buhari surfaced on social media as he was cheering the national team to victory at the state house in Abuja.
