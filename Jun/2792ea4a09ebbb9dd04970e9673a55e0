For 75 years, US WW2 Veteran KT Robbins kept a photo of his French sweetheart Jeannine Ganaye, who he met during the war, and on the 75th anniversary of the D-Day Landings, he travelled to commemorate the day, only to find her again! He had shown journalists Jeannine’s photo, with hopes that they find her or her family… and they did. “She’s alive and she’s waiting for you,” a journalist told him. The journalists organised a reunion for the both of them and it’s so sweet! Watch:  "She's alive and she's waiting for you." They fell in love during the war, and on the anniversary of the D-Day landings, a US veteran and his French sweetheart have been reunited.
