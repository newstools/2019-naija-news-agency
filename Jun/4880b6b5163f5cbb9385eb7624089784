 Arsenal have made Celtic left-back Kieran Tierney a top summer transfer target. The 22-year-old has helped the Hoops win a historic domestic treble treble over the past three campaigns. But theÂ Daily MailÂ report that the Scottish champions face a fight to keep their full-back with Arsenal keen to bring him to the Premier League.[ Gunners boss Unai Emery wants backline reinforcements after poor defensive displays cost the North Londoners a place in next seasonâ€™s Champions League. And with Nacho Monreal now 33, the Spaniard has made the Scotland international his number 1 left-back target. The defender;s current contract doesnâ€™t expire until 2023 meaning itâ€™s thought the Bhoys wonâ€™t consider an offer unless itâ€™s at least in the region of Â£20million. However, despite being on a lower budget than any of the other â€˜big-sixâ€™, Emery feels it would be a good investment considering the Celtic manâ€™s age and talent. Tierney has played 167 senior club matches and made his competitive debut back in 2015 at the age of 17. The post Arsenal Boss Unai Emery Wants To Sign Celtic Star Source: Independent
