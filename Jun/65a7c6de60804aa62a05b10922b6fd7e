Earlier this week, international online betting platform, Betway, donated sports kits to G12, a grassroots football club in Lagos Island, Lagos State at an event at the teams home ground, Campos Field. With this initiative, Betway further strengthens its tag-line, â€œFor the Love of the Gameâ€� as it continues to support the development of sports in the country. Here are 3 Takeouts from Betway latest CSR efforts. Nigeria is blessed with many football talents: The G12 football club, in the last three years, has been able to produce a steady flow of talented and well-groomed football players who have been good enough to be scouted for the U17 team. With this donation from Betway, the young players at G12 will perform even better. Betway continues to support the growth and development of grassroots football: This donation is another proof of Betwayâ€™s commitment to growing grassroots football in the country.Â  Last year, the Principal Sponsors of West Ham United, organized the first ever 5 s-side league in the country. The league was organized primarily to tap into the culture of Â 5 a-side football and also serve as a platform where young football players can showcase their numerous talents. Grassroots football in Nigeria is still underdeveloped: Many grassroots football clubs in the country are privately owned and managed. The government, over the years, has failed to develop a working formula that will ensure that young talents are discovered and nurtured, leaving many clubs to independently recruit and nurture these players with help from corporate entities like Betway.  Betway continues to provide a Nigerian sports fan with multiple betting features and promotions such as Win Boost, 4 to score and many more.
