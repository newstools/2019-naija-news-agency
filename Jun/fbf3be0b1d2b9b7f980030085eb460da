 Just six weeks after it was launched, Nigel Farageâ€™s Brexit Party dug up Britainâ€™s political landscape by topping the polls in the UKâ€™s European Parliament election, gaining 29 MEPs across the country, According to Theweek.co.uk. It was an astonishing result, not least given that the embryonic movement claimed victory without releasing a manifesto – a word Farage has eliminated from his vocabulary – or committing to any policies beyond ensuring the UKâ€™s prompt withdrawal from the EU. Some polls suggest the party could win a general election, yet voters still have no details as to what else the Brexit Party stands for. Mike Greene, who narrowly lost out on becoming the partyâ€™s first MP in the Peterborough by-election, defended the decision to run without a set platform. â€œWe donâ€™t want a manifesto because we believe itâ€™s come to mean political broken promises,â€� he explained. â€œWe donâ€™t want to make theoretical promises, we want practical delivery.â€� But critics say the partyâ€™s dogged refusal to be drawn on its vision for Britain beyond an uncoupling from the European Union allows its candidates to avoid accountability. â€œA manifesto is essentially a record by which voters can judge what issues parties prioritise, and what MPs stand for so that if theyâ€™re elected, voters can judge them on what theyâ€™ve achieved,â€� former Labour strategist James Mills writes in The Independent. Without one, a party â€œpretend to be all things to all peopleâ€�, he says. â€œIf we now let the Brexit Party avoid this essential aspect of democracy then we risk allowing candidates to deceive their way into parliament, hoodwinking voters in the process.â€� So what does the party actually stand for – besides securing Britainâ€™s exit from the EU? A look at the partyâ€™s website offers no clues, with no information about its platform beyond a single reference to â€œour campaign to implement Brexit, uphold democracy and change politics for goodâ€�. Addressing a rally in West Yorkshire last month, Farage told supporters that a â€œfull slateâ€� of policies would be released after the EU elections. Although this has yet to make an appearance, Farageâ€™s speech did contain a handful of clues as to what is on his mind beyond Brussels, suggesting that a Brexit Party government would back â€œpolitical reform, more help for the regions, scrapping of ludicrous projects like HS2â€�. The partyâ€™s constitution, submitted to the Electoral Commission and later made public using a freedom of information request, offers more insight. The document describes the partyâ€™s philosophy as â€œdemocratic, classic liberalâ€� and says its policies will â€œpromote and encourage those who aspire to improve their personal situation and those who seek to be self-reliant, whilst providing protection for those genuinely in needâ€�. The constitution strikes a libertarian note, committing to â€œfavour the ability of individuals to make decisions in respect of themselves [and] seek to diminish the role of the Stateâ€� as well as lowering taxes on both individuals and businesses. Strengthening the UKâ€™s borders and promoting the rule of law are also mentioned as goals in the brief â€œobjectivesâ€� section. But even though the constitution is â€œtheoreticallyâ€� binding, the â€œstructure of the Brexit Party and its parent company places Farage in an almost uniquely powerful position in British politicsâ€�, says Politico. Farage isnâ€™t just the leader of the Brexit Party, the website says, but â€œthe CEO, chairman and owner combinedâ€�. Because the party has no members – only â€œregistered supportersâ€� – he has almost total control over its direction. And what he intends to do with that power remains to be seen. The set up for Farageâ€™s new party means he is free to do what he wants â€” and so far itâ€™s working. The post What Brexit Partyâ€™s Policies Are Source: Independent
