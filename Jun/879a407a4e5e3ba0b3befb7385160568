 An imam has been jailed for two years for providing migrants with inflatable boats to cross the English Channel from France. The 39-year old political refugee from Iran fainted as the French court handed down the sentence, skynews reports. A 29-year old Senegalese man who attended the mosque where the imam preached was also sentenced to 18 months in prison. Both men were banned from living in or visiting Nord and Pas-de-Calais, for five and three years respectively. The court heard the imam, whose name has not been released, was traced after police found life jackets and a rubber dinghy on a beach in Pas-de-Calais, in northern France. The boatâ€™s registration number led investigators to its former owner. His involvement was discovered through telephone records, and during a search of his house in Rouen officers found two more boats, three engines and around 20 life jackets. Both men admitted buying seven boats between December 2018 and April 2019, but denied knowing from the start that they would be used for illegal crossings to the UK. According to the prosecution, the imam was in contact with human traffickers and took a commission on the sale of each boat.
