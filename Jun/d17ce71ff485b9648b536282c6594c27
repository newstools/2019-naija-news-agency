 United States (US) tennis star Serena Williams has made history as the first athlete to make Forbesâ€™ list of the Worldâ€™s Richest Self-Made Women. According to the publication, the 23-time Grand Slam champion made the list as a result of her estimated fortune of $224m (Â£177m). The majority of Williamâ€™s fortune has been made as a result of her â€œbrain and brand rather than her backhandâ€�, according to Forbes, with the star investing in 34 startup businesses in the past five years alone. Opening up about her financial investments, Williams told the publication: â€œI want to be in the infrastructure. I want to be the brand, instead of just being the face.â€� In April, Williams announced she was launching her own venture-capital firm. Forbes reports that 60 per cent of Williamsâ€™ investments so far have gone to companies led by women or people of colour.
