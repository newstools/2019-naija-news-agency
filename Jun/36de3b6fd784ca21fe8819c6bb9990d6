 Internet monitoring platform NetBlocks is reporting a “near total restriction” on Sudanâ€™s remaining internet connectivity as of 12:00 p.m. UTC Monday 10 June, amid reports of deadly attacks perpetrated by Sudanese paramilitary groups. Military and paramilitary forces had unleashed mayhem on pro-democracy protesters last week, leaving over 100 people dead. The notorious Rapid Support Forces (Janjaweed 2.0) which was re-organised in 2013 by the country’s former dictator Omar Bashir continue to patrol the streets days after the deadly raid. Bashir was forced to step down in April and pro-democracy groups have been advocating for a transition to an elected government since then. The military has said it a transitional military government will lead the country for 2 years. African Union has suspended Sudan following the massacre.
