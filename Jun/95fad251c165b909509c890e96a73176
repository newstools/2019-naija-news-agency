The United Kingdom government has issued a warning to its citizens in Nigeria to stay away from 24 states in Nigeria prone to terror attacks. Some of the states blacklisted by the UK government Katsina, Borno, Yobe Adamawa, Gombe States, and many others.

The statement read: â€œThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to: Borno State
