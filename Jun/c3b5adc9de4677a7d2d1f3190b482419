 The Reds ended their campaign in brilliant style by securing their sixth European Cup thanks to goals from Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi that downed Tottenham. It came three weeks after being pipped to the Premier League title by Manchester City. â€œA second ago I spoke to Pep Guardiola on the phone,â€� Klopp said at his post-match press conference. â€œOur head physio (Lee Nobes) worked for Manchester City at the start of the year but he wanted to win the Champions League… no, it’s a joke. â€œWe promised each other that we will kick each other’s butts again next season. We will go for everything and see what we get. â€œGetting 97 points in the Premier League and winning the Champions League is an unbelievable long way to go and we did it. That’s incredible. â€œNow we’ve won something, we will carry on. We will win things. That is big. I am really happy.â€� Jurgen Klopp had lost six finals in a row before leading Liverpool to their first trophy under his guidance. The build up to the game was dominated by Kloppâ€™s record but he is refusing to get carried away after ending his trophy hoodoo. â€œWe spoke two days ago about my â€˜unluckyâ€™ career somehow,â€� he said. â€œWhen I hear it I think, â€˜Yeah, people could see it like thisâ€™, but I donâ€™t feel it, to be honest because I always see the way to a final as well because thatâ€™s of course important for me as well. â€œI think my life is much better than I ever expected it, so winning something is good, itâ€™s cool, but itâ€™s for all the other people. Iâ€™m not so much in it, Iâ€™m much more really in development but I get it, we have to win things, so for us itâ€™s really important that people donâ€™t ask now all the time about not winning or winning things. â€œNow we won something and we will carry on. We want to win things, 100 per cent. Iâ€™ve said it, this is only the start for this group. Jurgen Klopp is the fourth Liverpool manager to win the European Cup (Pic: GETTY)
â€œItâ€™s still a wonderful age group, they all have the best times in their careers ahead of them so thatâ€™s big. â€œFor me, Iâ€™m really happy. I have a lot of silver medals and now I have a golden one so itâ€™ll be next to the silver medals in my house and thatâ€™s cool. â€œBut mostly Iâ€™m happy for all the other people. When you see it now in the dressing room, everybody feels it but you donâ€™t really know what to do with it. â€œBut tomorrow Iâ€™m really sure when we drive through the city, then we all will realise what these boys have done and thatâ€™s the best moment, for sure.â€� The post Jurgen Klopp Reveals Pep Guardiola Promise After CL Win Source: Independent
