 Tottenham have stepped up their efforts to sign Tanguy Ndombele by offering Lyon Â£60million. Mauricio Pochettino wants the midfielder and the club will prioritise him before pursuing other deals, though they face competition from Juventus. The 22-year-old was also wanted by Manchester City before they switched their attention to Atletico Madridâ€™s Rodri. The SunÂ report a source at the French club â€˜believe thatÂ TottenhamÂ are serious about pursuing a deal for Ndombele this windowâ€™. Lyon signed Ndombele from Amiens for Â£7m last summer after he spent the 2017/18 season on loan and Spurs see him as a long-term replacement to Mousa Dembele. Dembele was loved by both Pochettino and the White Hart Lane faithful, but left for Chinese side Guangzhou R&F in January.
