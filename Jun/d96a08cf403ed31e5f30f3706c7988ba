 Melissa McCarthy is in talks to play Disney villain Ursula in the upcoming live-action remake of The Little Mermaid. The Academy Award nominated actress is in discussions to join the remake of the 1989 animated classics, according to reports in Variety according to rte.ie. In The Little Mermaid, Ursula is a scary sea witch who tries to capture Ariel by granting her wish to become a human and live above sea level – but it’s not that straightforward and Ariel must pay a price. Chicago, Into the Woods and Mary Poppins Returns director Rob Marshall will helm the film, and he previously said he hopes to add more songs to his version of the story. “We’re working on, in a way, fleshing out The Little Mermaid – Ariel has one song in the animated film – and so we’re looking for maybe more material,” he said. A release date for The Little Mermaid has yet to be announced. The post Melissa McCarthy In Talks To Play Ursula In The Little Mermaid Remake  Source: Independent
