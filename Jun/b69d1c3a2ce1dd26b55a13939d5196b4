 The yellow vests called for demonstrations this Saturday and tomorrow throughout France with a view to relaunching the movement, after a decline in mobilization in recent weeks. On the 29th Saturday of actions, several demonstrations are planned in this capital and in other cities of the country like Bordeaux, Montpellier and Strasbourg, while the leaders call for a massive attendance. The aim is to reverse the downward trend in participation observed in recent weeks. Last Saturday, the Ministry of the Interior reported a mobilization figure of 12,500 across France, much lower than the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators registered at the beginning of the movement. The yellow vests began to take to the streets in November 2018 and although at first demonstrators opposed the increase in fuel prices decreed by the government, the demands extended to include taxes in general and the loss of purchasing power as a result of government policy. Now they also demand that the Constitution be reformed for the sake of full democracy and that citizens have the possibility to ask for and promote the holding of national referendums on relevant issues.
