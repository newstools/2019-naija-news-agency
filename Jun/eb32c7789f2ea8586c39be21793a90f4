 Ric Hassani is currently on a music tour of some selected African countries and south American and Carribean countries. After shutting down the likes of Mauritius in Africa, the talented and sweet-voiced singer moved to Honduras. During his show in the country, Ric Hassani was overwhelmed with what he saw. The large crowd screaming his name and singing his songs words for words. He posted a video of how it all went down with a caption that preaches surprise, amazement, amusement and thrill. He wrote; “Unbelievable. Thank you Roatan for giving me this moment. You sang every song back to me, just unbelievable. Thank you God for being beside me. My manager, my team, & Heaven, we did it, we sold out! Thank You.” Unbelievable. Thank you Roatan for giving me this moment. You sang every song back to me, just unbelievable. Thank you God for being beside me. My manager, my team, & Heaven, we did it, we sold out! Thank You.?
