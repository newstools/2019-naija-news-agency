 Peter Crouch announced the birth of his baby boy with a humorous tweet. The former Liverpool and Tottenham striker wrote: “Our beautiful baby boy was born Monday June 3rd mother and baby Divock Samrat Crouch are doing well”, according to Mirror.co.uk reports. Crouch, 38, previously joked he and his wife Abbey Clancy were thinking about calling their fourth child Samrat after his favourite curry house.  He apparently opted to name the baby Divock instead – with Samrat as a middle name – in tribute to Liverpool forward Divock Origi, who netted the Reds’ second in their 2-0 win over Tottenham in the Champions League final on the weekend. Of course, Crouch, who is known for his great sense of humour, was having a laugh with his many Twitter followers. He followed up his initial tweet, writing: “Our boy is beautiful the name is still to be clarified unfortunately. Not going for Divock Samrat.” Back in March Crouch joked on his podcast that he was genuinely considering the name Samrat. He said: “One of the bookies is taking bets on names for my little one. Harry is top. “And at 100/1 was Samrat and I’ve had a good few people saying ‘You’ve got to do it’ – Samrat Crouch. “It’s genuinely 100/1…it does work, because you’d just call him Sam. Shane is actually bigger odds than Samrat.” Crouch was then asked: “[And] Abbey would be alright with that wouldn’t she?’ to which he replied: “She’d be alright with it, yeah.” Crouch concluded: “The favourite is Harry at the minute…I do like that name. “Jacob, June, Mary – they’re all 100/1, along with Samrat, BabyNo4 and Hat-trick!!! “Samrat is gender neutral and so is BabyNo4 Crouch or Hat-trick.” The post Peter Crouch, Abbey Clancy Announce Birth Of Baby Boy appeared first on Independent Newspapers Nigeria.
