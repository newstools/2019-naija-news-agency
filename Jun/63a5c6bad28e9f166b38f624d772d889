 Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles coach, has dropped Kelechi Iheanacho, Leicester City forward, and Rotterdamâ€™s Semi Ajayi from the 23-man final squad for the 2019 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt. Ihenacho, who had a tough season with less of play time during the English Premier League season, was dropped due to â€œlack of fitnessâ€�. In the last season, he came on for Leicester city as a substitute 21 times, started four times in the EFL cup and scored just one goal. He featured just once for The Foxes in the 2018/19 FA Cup. Ajayi, who had a splendid season with his championship side, also failed to scale the talents in the defence. Rohr unveiled his squad after the teamâ€™s friendly 0-0 match against Zimbabwe on Saturday. FC Midtjylandâ€™s Paul Onuachu and Victor Osimhen of Royal Charleroi, Belgium, are the new call ups in the Super Eagles. The team will depart for Egypt on Sunday aboard a chartered aircraft to set up a final training camp in the city of Ismailia. The Eagles will take on Africaâ€™s â€œnumber oneâ€� team, Senegal, in their final pre-AFCON friendly on June 16. Nigeria will confront Burundi, Guinea and Madagascar in Group B of the 32nd continental tournament taking place in four Egyptian cities between June 21 and July 19.
