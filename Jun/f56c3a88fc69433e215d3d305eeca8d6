E-money Okonkwo reeks of class whenever he steps out and has a way of stealing the show whenever he does that.
Â 
Billionaire and Five Star Group chairman, E-Money and his wife, Juliet made a grand entry to ‘Funnybone Comedy Show’ held over the weekend.
Â 
The couple became the cynosure of all eyes as they looked elegantly dressed. E-money who is a serial entrepreneur drives some of the best cars in Lagos State.

The young man technically has the world at his feet. He is a face people seek to see when they attend social gatherings and he sponsors several celebrities. ~
