Man wrongly sentenced to death regains freedom after 16 years in jail The guest of honour and executive director of Eleganza Industries Limited , Chief Mrs. Shade Okoya,Â  urgedÂ  women to work together to support other women in a bid to thrive andÂ  excel together. The keynoteÂ  speaker,Â  ProfessorÂ  John Aremu of Covenant University,Â  while speaking on the topic, â€˜Women in Business Paradigm Shift: The vista and opportunitiesâ€™ stated that the ECOWAS TradeÂ  Liberation Scheme (ETLS)Â  will encourage women to increase their trade with other countries in the region as well as allow business activities and projects. To be designed from a regional perspective for greater efficiencies and cost- sharing between relevant stakeholders across the region. He said: â€œAs ETLS allows new players into Nigeria markets, expensive goods are replaced with cheaper goods from other countries within ECOWAS region while manufacturers from outside the community may have to cut their prices to exports to the region. This is good for our women. â€œSince each of you has a comparative advantage in different areas of production, ETLS allows you to gain from such specialisation across the region. â€œBecause ETLS engenders specialization in goods and services in which you have comparative advantage, the initiative will lead you to enjoy economies of scale in your activities.â€� He therefore urged governments of ECOWAS members states and the ECOWAS CommissionÂ  to create the necessary environment for private sector whose primary responsibility is the movement of goods across the borders.
