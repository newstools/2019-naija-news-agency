 Crystal Palace want Manchester United to remove a sell-on fee in Wilfried Zahaâ€™s contract as a sweetener in talks to sign Eagles defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka. United had an opening bid of around Â£40m turned down for Wan-Bissaka as Palace value him at closer to Â£60m. The Red Devils are expected to return with an improved offer but are unlikely to stretch as far as Palaceâ€™s valuation of the 21-year-old. Manchester City paid Â£50m for Kyle Walker in 2017, making him the most expensive English defender of all-time according to Metro.co.uk.
