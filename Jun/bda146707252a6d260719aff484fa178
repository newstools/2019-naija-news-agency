Nigerian entertainer, Tunde Ednut allegedly attacked a lady identified as Trina Joness on Instagram over a comment she left on his page. The singer who is prominent on his Instagram page for his constant giveaways and entertainment gossip, shared a series of post on top 10 celebrity count down. However, the lady felt it was unfair that Don Jazzyâ€™s song, All Is In Order got the number 1 spot and so she voiced it out in the comment section. She claimed that the entertainer deleted her comment, slid in her dm to insult her and ended up blocking her. See screenshots below, ~
