VIDEO: King Promise – My Lady Ghanaian hotshot, King Promise, dishes out a fresh video for “My Lady“; another single off his recently released album “As Promised“. The singer, who’s currently on a promo tour in Lagos, has been serving up videos (see “Commando” and “Bra“) since his debut album dropped back in July. The Killertunes-produced cut, My Lady, is the 3rd one this Summer, and with a crisp video shot in New York, this is set to become another fan favorite. Those who know me personally would tell you how big a fan I am of this guy. Check out the visuals below. Fire jam!
