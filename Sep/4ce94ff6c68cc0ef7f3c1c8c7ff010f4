The Champions League group stage continued on Wednesday night, with brilliant clashes including Paris Saint-Germain vs Real Madrid and Atletico vs Juventus. After some entertaining games on Tuesday, there was a brilliant line-up on Wednesday. Starting with PSG vs Real Madrid, it was the French side who came out on top. Angel Di Maria scored two goals against his former club, before Thomas Meunier secured a 3-0 win. Meanwhile, Juventus were held against Atletico Madrid after a late Héctor Herrera goal. Juan Cuadrado’s brilliant finish initially put Juve ahead. Manchester City also got their campaign underway, winning 3-0 against Shakhtar Donetsk. Riyad Mahrez scored the first goal for Pep Guardiola’s City after some brilliant work from İlkay Gündoğan, before the German scored a goal of his own. Gabriel Jesus then made sure of all three points. Elsewhere, Bayern Munich opened their campaign with a 3-0 win over Crvena zvezda, while Dinamo Zagreb beat Atalanta 4-0 and Lokomotiv Moscow bested Bayer Leverkusen. Now, we’ve looked at three key points from Wednesday’s games. @cuadrado @blaisematuidiofficiel = win for @juventus? #UCL A post shared by  UEFA Champions League (@championsleague) on Sep 18, 2019 at 1:27pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Thibaut Courtois just can’t catch a break, can he? The Belgian was brilliant for Chelsea during his time in the Premier League and much was expected of him when he joined Real Madrid. Needing a world-class goalkeeper, Madrid pushed through a deal for Courtois but based on his performances since joining, they may regret choosing him.

Angel Di Maria’s double and Meunier’s goal also means that the Belgian hasn’t kept a clean sheet since back in February. What made it even worse is that Di Maria’s first goal beat Courtois at the near post, which has been a regular occurrence since the Belgian joined Real Madrid. For his sake, he needs to turn it around and soon.

It was just last season when the Argentine put in a man of the match performance against Manchester United at Old Trafford. He seemingly relished the chance to play the pantomime villain, and it was a similar case against Real Madrid. The Argentine featured in 190 games for Los Blancos, and came up against his former club on Wednesday evening. As he did when facing Manchester United, Di Maria showed up and produced a brilliant performance. The Argentine beat Courtois at his near post for the first goal, before a stunning finish into the bottom corner for his second. He will no doubt be looking forward to the second leg at the Bernabeu.

Aymeric Laporte was ruled out of action until 2020 recently, meaning that City had just John Stones and Nicolás Otamendi as their fit senior central defenders. That was until John Stones picked up an injury in the clash with Norwich, leading to a reported five-week injury lay-off. That meant that only Nicolás Otamendi remains. With all eyes on the Manchester City line-up, it was Fernadinho who was chosen as Pep Guardiola’s emergency central defender. Incredibly, the Brazillian didn’t look out of place in the slightest. With Man City’s defensive problems, it certainly looks as though Fernandinho will be used in the Premier League over the next month or so until John Stones returns. Safe to say, teams will certainly be looking to exploit that.
