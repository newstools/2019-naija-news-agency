Professor Yemi Osinbajo – Vice President of Nigeria The Vice President of Nigeria, Prof Yemi Osinbajo has commented on the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa. Speaking to reporters in Kano state, Osinbajo, pointed out that the situation is condemnable and unfortunate, especially considering the role of Nigeria during South Africa’s apartheid regime. In a statement, released by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, the VP said: “Let me say first that these recent attacks are condemnable. It is very sad and very unfortunate that the lives and livelihoods of Nigerians living in South Africa are once again being destroyed with such wantonness and with such carelessness and recklessness. “It is unfortunate because Nigeria and Nigerians invested a great deal in the destruction and pulling down of apartheid. Besides, these acts of bigotry are entirely contrary to the very ideals that all the great South African leaders, including the present President fought for, and for which many gave their lives. “Mr President has already spoken about this; and obviously we are very concerned and certainly intend to take this up with the authorities in South Africa in order to ensure that this sort of thing does not repeat itself. This is absolutely unacceptable and unconscionable.”   #BellaNaija bellanaija.com A post shared by  BellaNaija (@bellanaijaonline) on Sep 3, 2019 at 11:17am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js The post Xenophobic Attacks on Nigerians are Reckless and Unacceptable – Osinbajo appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
