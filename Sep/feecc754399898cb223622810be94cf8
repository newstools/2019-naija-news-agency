Arsenal hosted Tottenham this past Saturday in the first North London derby of the 2019/20 season. The Gunners found themselves 2-0 down heading into the break before Alexandre Lacazette pulled one back on the stroke of half time. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang would then bring Arsenal level with honors even come full-time. Matteo Guendouzi was one of Arsenal’s better players on the day vs Spurs and provided this superb assist for Aubameyang’s equaliser. Just how has Matteo seen that pass? 🤭 Magic from @MatteoGuendouzi 🧙‍♂️#ARSTOT pic.twitter.com/gp05YZpJWn — Arsenal (@Arsenal) September 2, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Arsenal’s Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (CL) and Arsenal’s French midfielder Matteo Guendouzi (CR) celebrate after Aubameyang latched onto Guendouzi’s pass to score their second goal to equalise 2-2 during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur at the Emirates Stadium in London on September 1, 2019.

Pires mentions how Guendouzi patrols the defensive midfield area, wins the ball, tackles well and how the youngster plays the ball quickly and simply: “Matteo is a warrior. He had a fantastic match. “He’s a combative player and what I like about him is that he is consistent with that. He does his job, patrolling defensive midfield, winning the ball, tackling well, and then playing the ball quickly and simply. “That’s why he is an important player for Unai and for Arsenal. I liked the reaction of the team to going 2-0 down, the manner of the response.” As quoted by the Mirror. Guendouzi also seems to have caught the eye of France boss Didier Deschamps as the Arsenal star has been called up to the France side as a replacement for Paul Pogba, who is suffering from an ankle problem. .@MatteoGuendouzi est arrivé ce matin à Clairefontaine pour le rassemblement des Espoirs mais il passera finalement les 8 prochains jours avec l’Equipe de France A en remplacement de Paul Pogba (cheville) ! 🇫🇷 #FiersdetreBleus pic.twitter.com/jklmAJCord — Equipe de France ⭐⭐ (@equipedefrance) September 2, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Related: Paul Merson takes aim at Arsenal boss Emery after Spurs draw: ‘It’s like Unai Wenger is running things’ Is Granit Xhaka’s discipline causing Arsenal issues? | Paul Merson & Gary Rowett | The Debate Source: Great Goals Arsenal under Unai Emery is still very much a work in progress.
