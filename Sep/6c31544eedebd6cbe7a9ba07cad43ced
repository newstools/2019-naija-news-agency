Chelsea have this evening been dealt a worrying blow on the injury front, during the club‚Äôs Champions League meeting with Valencia. Frank Lampard‚Äôs Blues got their return to the top tier of European football underway a short time ago, at Stamford Bridge. The capital giants welcomed managerless Valencia to London, for a Group H opener. Chelsea no doubt headed into proceedings brimming with confidence, having gotten their domestic form back on track in scintillating fashion at Wolves over the weekend. The Pensioners picked up a 5-2 win at Molineux, with the in-form Tammy Abraham having proven the star of the show. The English hitman notched a hat-trick, sandwiched between further strikes from Fikayo Tomori and Mason Mount, as Chelsea‚Äôs young English contingent continued their stellar opening to the campaign. 2 ‚Äì Tammy Abraham is the third player in Premier League history to score 2+ goals in three consecutive appearances aged 21 or younger, after Cristiano Ronaldo in December 2006 and Dele Alli in January 2017.
