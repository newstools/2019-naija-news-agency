La Liga champions Barcelona have this evening confirmed that talisman Lionel Messi will be fit to feature from the off versus Borussia Dortmund. Ernesto Valverde’s men are set to get their Champions League campaign underway tomorrow night, with a trip to Germany. The Blaugrana will visit the home of Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund, for what is no doubt set to be a goal-filled affair. Dortmund head into the high-profile clash on the back of a 4-0 thumping of Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday afternoon. Paco Alcacer, Marco Reus (2) and Raphael Guerreiro bagged the goals for Lucien Favre’s men. Barcelona, meanwhile, also secured an impressive win this past weekend. After enduring a difficult start to the defence of their La Liga title, the Catalan powerhouse got things firmly back on track, courtesy of a 5-2 victory over Valencia. Ansu Fati, Frenkie de Jong, Gerard Pique and Luis Suarez (2) found the target for the hosts at the Camp Nou. Barca’s latest win, like the rest of their campaign to this point, though, came without the contribution of star man Lionel Messi. Argentine attacker Messi has spent the early weeks of the new season on the sidelines, with a calf problem. This has seen Ernesto Valverde unable to call on Messi in any of his side’s 4 La Liga outings thus far, a key factor in their having already dropped 5 points in the defence of the club’s league title. But, in a timely boost to the prospects of the Blaugrana not only on the domestic front, but also in Europe, it has this evening been confirmed that Messi has returned to full fitness. In a post across Barcelona’s social media channels a short time ago, it was announced that both the 31-year-old, and backup goalkeeper Neto, are available to feature from the off at the Westfalenstadion tomorrow night: ❗ [INJURY NEWS] Leo #Messi and Neto declared fit for @ChampionsLeague opener 😀👏 pic.twitter.com/WGN7BgRQlk — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) September 16, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js He.
