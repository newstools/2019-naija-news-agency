Unai Emery has somewhat of a rather strange system regarding his captains. The former PSG man prefers to have a rather big total of five players he can name captain. The Telegraph have previously claimed that players like Aaron Ramsey, Petr Cech and Laurent Koscielny have been part of the captain group. But with that trio no longer at the club, Emery will need to promote some new players to the captain role. However, according to Rob Holding, the Arsenal players have had a say on who should be their captains. Holding claims the players wrote names down and gave them to Emery. Holden also stated that he would be honoured to be captain and that he didn’t vote for himself: “He [Emery] likes his five captains. We had a vote the other week, so we’ll see what happens and see who gets named. “It was just writing names down and then giving them to the manager. He will go through them obviously with his input and we’ll see what happens. If I get it, then I’ll be more than happy and honoured to do it. “I didn’t [vote for myself]. I don’t know the rules but I didn’t. I can’t say who I voted for.” As quoted by the Evening Standard.

The central defender has been out of action since being injured vs Manchester United in December of 2018. Arsenal came away with a comfortable 5-0 win vs Forest with Holding completing the game. Mesut Ozil captained Arsenal vs Forest but when the German came off Holding was handed the armband. Holding would describe being named vice-captain vs Forest as an honour: “When I was told I was going to be vice-captain [against Nottingham Forest] it was an honour. “As soon as Mesut came off I knew I was getting the armband so it was just a great moment for me.” As quoted by the Evening Standard.
