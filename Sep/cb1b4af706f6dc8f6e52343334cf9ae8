Liverpool opened up a five point lead over Man City on Saturday. After Liverpool came from behind to beat Newcastle 3-1, Man City lost 3-2 at Norwich. Should Liverpool’s margin of victory have been greater? After Newcastle took a surprise lead at Anfield through Jetro Willems, the Reds felt they should have a penalty. Joel Matip was taken out by Jamaal Lascelles in the Magpies box during a corner. Lascelles grabbed the Liverpool defender around the neck, yet no spot-kick was given.

The German manager said: Was I surprised that it still wasn’t a penalty? Yes. That doesn’t help in situations like this, being surprised. For me it was a clear penalty. As long as you win then it’s not an issue. If we had lost 1-0 then we would speak differently about it but it is a penalty. We cannot fight like this for a ball. Joel Matip, there’s a wresting situation and he turns him in the air. In the past we didn’t need VAR to make this decision, so we shouldn’t have to use it now. To be clear, at the time of the incident, referee Andre Marriner originally decided that no penalty should be awarded. As confirmed by the Liverpool Echo, “the subsequent VAR check claimed the official hadn’t made a clear and obvious error in not awarding the spot kick.” That’s why VAR didn’t overturn the ref’s call. ESPN’s Dale Johnson has also tried to explain why VAR didn’t award Liverpool a penalty against Newcastle. Dale Johnson remembered another non-penalty decision during the recent match between Man City and Spurs. Tottenham fans felt that Erik Lamela should have won a penalty at the Etihad Stadium when he was taken out by Rodri during a corner. Rodri vs Erik Lamela: no penalty given However, when VAR looked at the decision, no penalty was given. That being the case, one can argue that VAR was actually applied even-handedly as Matip’s penalty call was waved away. Joel Matip penalty claim was very similar to Rodri-Lamela incident. If we use Rodri-Lamela as a yardstick, and remember it wasn't listed as a VAR error in Thursday's Premier League briefing, it makes sense there was no overturn. Probably should have been, though. #LIVNEW — Dale Johnson (@DaleJohnsonESPN) September 14, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The briefing on VAR on Thursday did highlight two missed penalties – Man City (Silva) at Bournemouth and West Ham (Haller) vs. Norwich. https://t.co/yi4NMVyRsr https://t.co/Hzb3dLtqgI — Dale Johnson (@DaleJohnsonESPN) September 14, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Also see: Watford vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions.
