 A week After young Nigerian rapper and singer, Olanrewaju Pelepele shared an emotional video online talking about how depressed he was and his plans to take his own life. At the time, he wasn’t taken seriously and now, he has made good on his promise and has taken his life. He was found stone-cold dead in his apartment on Friday, September 20th, 2019. His death stems from his long battle with depression and his inability to fully break into the Nigerian music industry despite 10years of hard work.
