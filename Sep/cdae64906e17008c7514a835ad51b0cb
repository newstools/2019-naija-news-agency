Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has this evening provided updates on the fitness of Emerson and Andreas Christensen, after both players were forced off during the club’s defeat to Liverpool. The Blues welcomed Jurgen Klopp’s men to Stamford Bridge earlier today, for a high-profile Premier League showdown. Both sides headed into proceedings searching for bounce-back results, having been on the receiving end of respective defeats in their Champions League openers during the week. When all was said and done in London, though, it was visitors Liverpool who emerged victorious. First-half goals from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Roberto Firmino proved the difference at full-time, as N’Golo Kante’s wonderful individual effort with 70 minutes on the clock eventually proved little more than a consolation for Chelsea. 6 – Liverpool are the first team in top-flight history to win their opening six matches of a top-flight season in two consecutive seasons.
