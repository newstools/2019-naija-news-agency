As confirmed by Swedish paper Aftonbladet on Thursday, Man Unitedâ€™s Victor Lindelof is refusing to speak with the Swedish media. Aside from Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Lindelof is the biggest football star in Sweden. Lindelof has refused to give any interviews with local press during the current international break. That includes in the mixed zone following the upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers. Sweden play away against the Faroe Islands tonight, before they host Norway on September 8.   ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª A post shared by  Victor LindelÃ¶f (@victorlindelof) on Sep 3, 2019 at 8:54am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Aftonbladet claim that Lindelof is upset with local media with respects to reports from earlier in the year. Lindelof failed to show up for Swedish international duty for matches against Romania and Norway in March. The Man United defender was heavily criticised for his no-show. Indeed, TV4 claimed that Lindelofâ€™s absence may have been connected to John Guidettiâ€™s omission from the squad. Days later, Lindelof became a dad for the first time. A few months ago, in an interview with Viasat, Lindelof expressed his anger towards TV4: People always wonder whatâ€™s behind things. What I cannot understand is how people cannot respect that it is a personal reason. ForÂ me, itâ€™s totally sick that you canâ€™t just respect it and let go.Â But thatâ€™s it, if you play football, you have to share everything that happens in your life. It may be, but I think it is totally sick.   Livet ropade.

The expectation is that Lindelof will end his media boycott once this international break finishes.
