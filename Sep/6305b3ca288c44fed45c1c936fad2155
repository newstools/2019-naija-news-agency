UEFA have released their 2018/19 Champions League technical report on Tuesday. The very detailed report which can be found here, covers a lot of things, including the fastest sprints in the 2018/19 Champions League tournament. UEFA’s report names the fastest 17 sprinters with some people in there you would probably expect to see such as Manchester City pairing Leroy Sane and Kyle Walker. Sane earned second spot with a speed of 34.4km/h while Walker earned third place with 34.2km/h. However, top spot may surprise some people as it belongs to Liverpool central defender, Virgil van Dijk. Van Dijk clocked a speed of 34.5km/h in Liverpool’s semi-final away leg vs FC Barcelona. Virgil van Dijk clocked 34.5km/h last season 😮 ℹ️ More stats & facts in 2018/19 #UCL technical report — UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) September 3, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js BARCELONA, SPAIN – MAY 1: (L-R) Virgil van Dijk of Liverpool FC, Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona during the UEFA Champions League match between FC Barcelona v Liverpool at the Camp Nou on May 1, 2019 in Barcelona Spain (Photo by David S.
