 New York-based contemporary Gospel artiste Sarai Korpacz released this song ‘All I Ever Need’ which premiered on the 4th of July this year. This is a song of acknowledgment and total submission to God’s will. It is also a testimonial song of God’s healing power from chronic pain sustained from an injury in 2018, thus she has this to say; All I Ever Need is a song about spiritual rediscovery. It is my desire that the song inspires hearts and minds to dwell richly in worshiping God, just as the Bible says in John 4:24, “God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.” – King James Version (KJV)’.We were created to worship Him – Sarai Korpacz stated.
