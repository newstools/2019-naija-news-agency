Phillipe Coutinho joined Barcelona in January of 2018. The Brazilian moved to Spain after impressing in the Premier League for Liverpool. However, for whatever reason, Coutinho never really looked at his best whilst playing for Barca. Coutinho was particularly poor throughout the 2018/19 campaign. In 34 La Liga outings that season, Coutinho would score just five and provide two assists, a very poor record considering he will have played alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez for a lot of those games.

Bayern are said to have the option to buy Coutinho once his loan runs out at the end of the season. However, it appears we could have seen the little magician once again honing his craft in the Premier League this season. According to Spanish outlet Marca, Barcelona offered Coutinho to Manchester City this summer but Pep Guardiola rejected the chance to sign him. The report from Marca also puts Bayern’s option to buy Coutinho fee at €120m. Coutinho played 33 minutes in Bayern’s 3-0 win over Schalke in their second game of the Bundesliga season. The 27-year-old then managed 67 minutes in Bayern’s 6-1 hammering of Mainz. Coutinho did not score or assist in either clash. Coutinho is now currently on international duty with Brazil.
