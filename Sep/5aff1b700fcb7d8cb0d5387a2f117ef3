Indeed, in 9 appearances this campaign, Haaland has 17 goals and 5 assists. Erling Braut Haaland is the son of former Man City and Leeds midfielder Alf Inge Haaland. He joined Salzburg from Molde back in January 2019. The Austrians have the forward under contract until 2023. Not anymore. Haaland was born in Leeds back in 2000, when he dad was still a Premier League footballer. That meant that Haaland could have played for England – he was eligible. However, Haaland has since made his debut for Norway in a competitive match. Accordingly, Gareth Southgate is unable to pick him for the Three Lions.   🇳🇴 A post shared by  Erling Braut Haaland (@erling.haaland) on Aug 27, 2019 at 9:10am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Famously in the summer, Erling Braut Haaland scored nine goals for Norway at the U20 World Cup against Honduras. No sooner had Haaland scored his hat-trick, transfer links to Man United popped up. The Mirror have published an article titled: “What Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said about Erling Braut Haaland making Man Utd transfer”. Solskjaer gave Haaland his debut at Molde last season. The Mirror also claim that “United scouts have (kept) tabs on the youngster”. However, when it came to any actual indications that Man United want to buy Haaland, the Mirror had nothing. Instead, the red-top dredged up old quotes from Solskjaer on Haaland from when OGS was Molde’s boss: He can become a top striker, for sure. He reminds me of the type of striker Lukaku is. He is probably not the world’s biggest Manchester United fan. Could Leeds United end up signing Haaland? The Mirror report that’s a possibility as Haaland has previously spoken about his love for the Yorkshire team: I want to be the best. The dream is to win the Premier League with Leeds – and to be a better player than dad. Just talked to Salzburgs Max Wober after Erling Haalands hat trick. He says «Erling is crazy. Last night our captain was walking with his daughter. Then a car stopped. Erling was inside. He rolled down the window. And there he was, listening to the Champions League anthem. — Joachim Baardsen (@JoachimB39) September 17, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Also see: Shakhtar Donetsk vs Manchester City betting tips: Champions League match preview & predictions.
