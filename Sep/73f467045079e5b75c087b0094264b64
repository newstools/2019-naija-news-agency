The Video Assistant Referee system is again the subject of widespread scrutiny this evening, after Liverpoolâ€™s defeat in Naples. Jurgen Kloppâ€™s men got their Champions League campaign underway a short time ago, with a trip to Serie A giants Napoli. The Reds no doubt headed into proceedings brimming with confidence, having extended their lead atop the Premier League table over the weekend. Before champions Manchester City fell to a shock 3-2 defeat at the hands of Norwich on Saturday evening, Liverpool secured 3 points once more, at home to Newcastle. A 3-1 win, courtesy of Sadio Mane (2) and Mohamed Salah, saw the Merseysiders make it 5 wins from 5 to start out the new league season. Bobbyâ€™s flick ðŸ˜±

As such, on the back of a tightly-contested pair of meetings between the sides in the Champions Leagueâ€™s group stage last season, a hard-fought affair was once again predicted tonight. And the subsequent 90 minutes at the Stadio San Paolo didnâ€™t disappoint. Though both Napoli and Liverpool largely struggled to carve out clear-cut chances for the majority of the clash, a fascinating encounter eventually saw the former emerge with a 2-0 win. The gameâ€™s opener came with 10 minutes to go, courtesy of Dries Mertens. The diminutive Belgian stepped up to slot beyond Adrian from the penalty spot, before substitute Fernando Llorente capitalised on a rare Virgil van Dijk error in injury-time to make sure of all 3 points for the hosts. Though Napoliâ€™s victory eventually came by means of a 2-goal margin, the Partenopeiâ€™s go-ahead strike was surrounded by controversy. After Jose Callejon cut inside Andy Robertson in the Liverpool box, the Spaniard went to ground under a challenge from the Scot, with initial viewing having suggested a blatant penalty. Replays, however, proved less clear-cut. While some stand by the claim that the correct call was indeed made in awarding a spot-kick, others are absolutely adamant that it was in fact Callejon who initiated the contact, before diving. As such, upon VAR checking the incident, the latter group insist that a â€˜clear and obvious errorâ€™ was indeed made by referee Felix Brych, which should have resulted in the decision being overturned, and Liverpool being handed the chance to come away with at least a share of the spoils: The clear and obvious error was that it was a total dive. How much more of an error do you need? Should have been a yellow card and free-kick to LFC. But weâ€™ll do these at Anfield again. â€” Paul Tomkins (@paul_tomkins) September 17, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Whatâ€™s the actual point in VAR if itâ€™s not being used correctly?
