RB Salzburg starlet Erling Haaland has today been rewarded for his superb Champions League bow during the week. Austrian giants Salzburg made their first appearance in the group stages of European club football’s top-tier competition for 25 years on Tuesday night. Jesse Marsch’s men welcomed Belgian outfit Genk to the Red Bull Arena, for their Group E opener. And, when all was said and done, it was the hosts who emerged victorious, after showing absolutely no sign of allowing their inexperience at Champions League level to overwhelm them. Salzburg found the net a whopping 6 times, including 5 during the opening 45 minutes, to eventually emerge with a 6-2 win. While Tuesday night obviously marked a special one for all associated with the Austrian champions, though, it proved a particularly memorable 90 minutes for one of the club’s brightest young stars. The player in question was Erling Braut Haaland. Haaland, son of former Manchester City and Leeds star Alf-Inge, stole the headlines versus Genk, with a superbly-taken hat-trick. This came on the Norwegian’s Champions League debut, and despite him having only turned 19 two months ago. 🇳🇴 Only player to net 9⃣ goals in an #U20WC game 👨‍🎓 Youngest to score a 1st-half hat-trick in Europe 3⃣rd-youngest to net a @ChampionsLeague treble after Raul & Rooney 1⃣7⃣ goals in 9⃣ games for 🇦🇹 Salzburg this term 😱 Alfie-Inge Haaland, your boy is absolutely frightening❗️ pic.twitter.com/MvyWCPlkZS — #TheBest 🏆 (@FIFAcom) September 17, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The plaudits have since unsurprisingly flowed for Haaland, with many having tipped the goal-scoring teen to go on to carve out a career for himself at the very top of the European game.
