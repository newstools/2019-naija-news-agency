Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has weighed in on the new contract handed to David De Gea last week, on the back of the Spaniard’s display versus West Ham. The Red Devils travelled to the London Stadium yesterday afternoon, to take on West Ham United. United headed into proceedings having put a disappointing streak of no wins in 3 firmly behind them over the previous week. First off, a solitary Marcus Rashford strike saw the Manchester giants put Leicester City to the sword at Old Trafford two weekends ago. And one goal again proved enough for United in their Europa League curtain-raiser last Thursday night, with youngster Mason Greenwood having been the player on the scoresheet versus Kazakh outfit Astana. ⚽️ Mason Greenwood has become @ManUtd‘s youngest ever scorer in Europe 👏 🥇 @_MasonGreenwood 17y & 353d

An abysmal showing on the part of the visitors eventually resulted in a 2-0 defeat. Andriy Yarmolenko put West Ham in front shortly before the interval, latching onto Felipe Anderson’s deft pass before finding the bottom corner of David De Gea’s net. And Aaron Cresswell made sure of all 3 points for the Irons 5 minutes from time, courtesy of a sumptuous free-kick. West Ham’s clincher, courtesy of Cresswell, though, despite having been superbly taken, subsequently saw David De Gea singled out for criticism by some. The United shot-stopper managed to get a hand to the set-piece, but not a strong enough one to keep the ball out of the top corner of his net. This, of course, came just days after De Gea put pen-to-paper on a massive new contract at Old Trafford: ✍️ @D_DeGea is here to stay! #MUFC #DaveSaves 👐 — Manchester United (@ManUtd) September 16, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js And one individual who feels as though the Spaniard’s shaky form over the second-half of last season, added to his largely-lacklustre showings over the early weeks of the new campaign, mean De Gea was fortunate to be handed such a lucrative new deal, is Jose Mourinho. Speaking on Sky Sports yesterday afternoon, the former United boss explained: ‘I think the moment he signed his huge contract is a moment that I don’t think Manchester United need to pay as much as they have.’ ‘One or two years ago the world was after him. At the moment, the majority of the big doors are closed. Real Madrid are closed. Barcelona are closed. Paris Saint-Germain are closed.’ ‘I don’t think United were under pressure because David was going to disappear. So, he gets a phenomenal contract in a moment when he’s a bit lucky to get it.’ Quotes via AS After West Ham, Man United confirm they are trying to compete ‘for trophies at the highest level’ Roy Keane on Man United: ‘It’s scary how far they have fallen’ Source: Great Goals
