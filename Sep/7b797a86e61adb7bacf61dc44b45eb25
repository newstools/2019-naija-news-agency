Watford manager Javi Gracia has this evening become the first managerial casualty of the Premier League season. On the back of an impressive campaign last time out, during which they battled for a Europa League berth, and made it all the way to the FA Cup final, the Hornets have, over the early weeks of the new season, majorly struggled. To this point, Watford have picked up just a solitary point from 4 Premier League outings. The opening 3 weeks of the campaign saw the Vicarage Road outfit fall to a trio of consecutive defeats. And, even after taking the lead with just two minutes on the clock in their last outing versus Newcastle, in the end, Watford could not hold out for a much-needed win, eventually slumping to a 1-1 draw. As such, reports across the English media this evening suggested that the Hornets’ early-season struggles were set to cost Javi Gracia his job. In a clear-as-day indictment of the ruthless nature of the current managerial scene, despite his solid work since being handed the reins at Vicarage Road in January of last year, and the Premier League campaign being just 4 fixtures old, Jonathan Northcroft of the Times reported that Gracia was ‘on the brink’ of being sent on his way by the Watford hierarchy: Hearing that Javi Gracia is on the brink at Watford…and they want to bring Quique Sanchez Flores back to replace him — Jonathan Northcroft (@JNorthcroft) September 7, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js And Watford have since made the news official. In a statement across the club’s social media platforms, Gracia’s sacking was announced a short time ago: ‘Watford Football Club confirms the departure of Head Coach Javi Gracia.’ ‘Javi Gracia’s staff will also be leaving the club, ahead of the imminent appointment of a new coaching team.’ Club Statement: Javi Gracia — Watford Football Club (@WatfordFC) September 7, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Average age of Premier League squads: Arsenal youngest, Liverpool oldest of top-6 England vs Bulgaria live streaming: Watch the Euro 2020 qualifier match online & confirmed line-ups Source: Great Goals
