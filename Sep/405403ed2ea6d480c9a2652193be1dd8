James Maddison has today spoken out over his future, amid mounting links between the Leicester star and Manchester United. Maddison, a 22-year-old attacking midfielder, only made the move to the King Power Stadium last summer, on the back of a stellar campaign in the Championship with Norwich City. And, despite his lack of Premier League experience, the Coventry youth product subsequently went on to take to the rigours of top-flight football like a duck to water. Maddison played a crucial role in Leicester’s top-half finish, starting in all but 3 of the Foxes’ Premier League outings. He also racked up a none-too-shabby 7 goals and 7 assists in the league alone, with the midfielder’s wicked set-piece delivery and free-kick prowess having lit up the King Power throughout the campaign. Perfectly showcasing just how impressive a creative outlet Maddison proved over the course of the season was the following statistic: James Maddison created the most chances (100) and scored more direct free-kicks (3) than any other player during the 2018-19 Premier League season. Does those sort of stats remind you of anyone? 🎯 pic.twitter.com/f5YnhtKMKX — Squawka Football (@Squawka) June 3, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Maddison’s creative streak, meanwhile, has since carried into the beginning of the new season, with 2 assists in Leicester’s first 4 outings. And it is this consistent excellence which has inevitably led to links between the midfielder and some of England’s top clubs. The outfit most persistently-named as keen suitors of Maddison over the summer, meanwhile, were Manchester United. United in pole position to sign Maddison ✍️

And Maddison went on to admit that he has his sights set firmly on testing his talents ‘at the highest level’ possible: ‘I want to play at the highest level my ability will allow me to.’ ‘I like to think I’ve my head screwed on with the transfers I’ve made.
