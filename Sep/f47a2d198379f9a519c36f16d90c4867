Confirmation of a blow for Wolves on the injury front has emerged online this afternoon. Nuno Espirito Santo‚Äôs men are set to welcome Chelsea to Molineux this weekend, for their latest Premier League outing. Wolves head into proceedings still in search of their first league win of the campaign, having picked up draws in three of their first 4 fixtures. The West Midlands outfit‚Äôs most recent outing, meanwhile, saw them fall to their first defeat of the season, at Everton: As such, with Chelsea likely still reeling on the back of allowing Sheffield United to fight back from 2 goals down to secure a point last time out, Wolves will be hoping to take advantage of the struggles of Frank Lampard‚Äôs men to get their campaign firmly back on track with 3 points. Ahead of welcoming the Blues to Molineux, though, the hosts have a pair of injury concerns to deal with. First off, Matt Doherty, who played such a key role in the superb campaign enjoyed by Nuno Espirito Santo‚Äôs side last season, has been sidelined of late with a knee problem. The Irish international remains a doubt to feature versus Chelsea. And, as confirmed across social media this afternoon, Wolves have since been dealt a further blow on the personnel front. The 2nd player to have picked up a problem is Romain Saiss. Versatile midfielder/defender Saiss started and found the net in Wolves‚Äô 3-2 defeat at Goodison Park last time out, but was forced to withdraw from international duty with the Morocco squad due to an ‚Äòunspecified injury‚Äô: üè• Wolves‚Äô Romain Saiss withdrew from the Morocco squad last week with an unspecified injury.#FFScout #FPL #GW5 #FantasyPL #WolvesFC ‚Äî Fantasy Football Scout (@FFScout) September 9, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Eight injury concerns: Chelsea early team news vs Wolves Chelsea blow: Emerson limps out of Italy‚Äôs clash with Finland Source: Great Goals
