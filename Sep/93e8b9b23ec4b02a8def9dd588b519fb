It looks highly unlikely that Marcus Rashford will take part in Man United’s upcoming games against Arsenal and Newcastle. Arsenal visit Old Trafford in the Premier League on Monday night. Newcastle host Man United in the league on October 6. Between those league games, Man United also travel to Holland to face AZ Alkmaar in the Europa League. Rashford suffered a groin in last weekend in United’s 2-0 defeat at West Ham. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has since provided the following update on the England international: Marcus, no he’s recovering. He’s not very, very bad. We hope to see him before the international break. 💬 Ole discusses the return of @PaulPogba, tonight's starting XI and the absence of @AGomes_47 and @DalotDiogo. #MUFC #CarabaoCup pic.twitter.com/dFi25NZotS — Manchester United (@ManUtd) September 25, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The Sun have interpreted Solskjaer’s comments as follows: Rashford is expected to miss the Premier League games against the Gunners and Newcastle, as well as the Europa League tie at AZ Alkmaar. He could also be in doubt for England’s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Montenegro in October. Man United are down to their bare bones when it comes to attacking options. Having loaned out Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez, and with Rashford’s latest injury, Mason Greenwood could be set to start in the league for United. Of course, Anthony Martial is also on the sidelines with a thigh problem. Accordingly, Greenwood could start against Arsenal, AZ and Newcastle.

Reporter Miguel Delaney believes that Man United are looking at two players: Mario Mandzukic and Ousmane Dembele. However, there are reasons to doubt whether either deal will happen. Miguel Delaney reported: United were willing to move for Mandzukic in the summer, but ultimately decided against a bid, with the player’s age – at 33 years old – a factor. It has been made known that Barca would be willing to do business on Dembele, and sources say he is “under consideration”. The French international would however likely cost in excess of £100m.

Mason Greenwood scored for the Red Devils in the 68th minute. However, the story of the game was a goal from Rochdale’s 16-year-old Luke Matheson to level the match.
