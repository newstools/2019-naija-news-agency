While PSG have continued to dominate Ligue 1 in recent years, the Champions League still alludes this new-look side. The French outfit blew a 2-0 lead vs Manchester United in the round of 16 last season and will be hoping things are different this time around. But the French giants must first get out of Group A, which consists of PSG, Real Madrid, Club Brugge and Galatasaray. PSGâ€™s 2019/20 Champions League campaign kicks off against Real Madrid on Wednesday evening. Real Madrid would announce their 19-man squad for the clash early on Tuesday.

(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images) The Madrid midfield department looks a little bit short-staffed to take on PSG with the likes of Luka Modric, Isco and Marco Asensio all out injured. However, PSG will also be without one of their biggest stars to take on Los Blancos. Mbappe would confirm late on Monday that he will not play vs Madrid but will give all his support from the stands: Mbappeâ€™s tweet translated into English reads as follows: Itâ€™s now official, I will not start our European campaign at home against Madrid. I am very sad not to be able to play but I will bring all my support from the stands to the team and I hope to return 100% to still and always give my best. Câ€™est dÃ©sormais officiel, je ne dÃ©buterai pas notre campagne europÃ©enne Ã  la maison contre Madrid.
Je suis trÃ¨s triste de ne pas pouvoir jouer mais jâ€™apporterai tout mon soutien depuis les tribunes Ã  lâ€™Ã©quipe et jâ€™espÃ¨re revenir Ã  100% pour encore et toujours donner mon maximum. pic.twitter.com/e8XNhZnzQL â€” Kylian MbappÃ© (@KMbappe) September 16, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js See also:Â Napoli vs Liverpool betting tips: Champions League preview & predictions Chelsea vs Valencia betting tips: Champions League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals Spanish giant Real Madrid are already preparing for the summer 2018 transfer market and are willing to pay 200 million euros to sign a star player.
