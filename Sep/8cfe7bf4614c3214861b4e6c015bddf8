Southampton have had a fairly average start to the 2019/20 season. The Saints head into the weekend’s action in 13th place with four points. Southampton’s last game saw them draw 1-1 with Manchester United, despite having 10 men for some of the second half. Ralph Hasenhuttl must now take his side to newly-promoted Sheffield United this weekend. Sheff United have had a promising start to life in the Premier League, winning one, drawing two and losing one.

Hasenhuttl confirmed that everyone who has recently been on international duty has come back without injuries. However, the Southampton boss goes on to state that Nathan Redmond is still not available: “You know that Kevin Danso is suspended, so he isn’t available. “Everybody is back from their international games without injuries, so that’s good news. The bad news is that Nathan [Redmond] is still not available, but he is making progress.” As quoted by Southampton’s official website. Hasenhuttl also spoke about Moussa Djenepo, Michael Obafemi and Ryan Bertrand: “With Moussa [Djenepo] it looks better; we aren’t sure whether it is enough to play this weekend. We’ll have to look. He can bring us something special, he showed it in the few minutes he’s played so far that he can make a difference. “The chances are not that big, but let’s see. I don’t want to take too much risk because it’s a very busy September. “Michael [Obafemi] is in training sessions as well as Ryan [Bertrand], they are both options. It has been good to regroup over the break, we’re looking forward.” As quoted by Southampton’s official website. Double tap if you’re as excited as the boss for Saturday, 3pm 😆 #premierleague #saintsfc A post shared by  Southampton FC (@southamptonfc) on Sep 12, 2019 at 1:18am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js See also: Sheffield United vs Southampton betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Manchester United vs Leicester City betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Liverpool vs Newcastle betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
