When the Premier League restarts after the international break, Man United welcome Leicester City to Old Trafford. After four rounds of the season, Leicester are third in the standings while Man United are eighth. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side will arrive to the Foxes match without a win in their last three games (two draws, one defeat). Meanwhile, Leicester are on a three-match winning run. Aaron Wan-Bissaka has enjoyed a bright start to his Man United career. While the right-back struggled against his former employers Crystal Palace, overall Wan-Bissaka’s performances have been positive. Indeed, Wan-Bissaka was called up for the current England squad. However, on Tuesday the defender pulled out of international duty with a back problem. Man United have posted the following injury update on Wan-Bissaka: Manchester United defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka has been forced to withdraw from the England squad due to a back issue. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be hoping the 21-year-old is available for United’s next assignment, the Premier League fixture with Leicester City at Old Trafford on 14 September. Accordingly, the hope is that AWB will be fit to face Leicester.

Pogba pulled out of the French squad following an ankle injury sustained at Southampton. On Pogba’s injury timetable, Man United posted the following on their club website: Pogba had played a full match for United at the weekend, in the 1-1 draw against Southampton in the Premier League, and it currently remains unclear how serious his injury might be. As ever, a full assessment will be made at the Aon Training Complex in due course. Last season, Pogba was on target for Man United as they beat Leicester 2-1 at Old Trafford in the Premier League.
