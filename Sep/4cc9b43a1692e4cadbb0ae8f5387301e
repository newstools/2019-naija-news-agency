 The Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry is teaming up with Oprah Winfrey for a documentary series on mental health. Speaking to Daily Telegraph, Harry said that opening up about his own mental health struggles on her podcast ‘Mad World’ inspired him to team up on the new project with Oprah. Prince Harry said he hopes it will show examples of “human spirit fighting back from the darkest places”. He added that he was “incredibly proud to be working alongside Oprah on this vital series, which we have been developing together for several months”. Speaking to the paper, the Duke said: When I did your podcast two years ago the response made me realise what an impact sharing my story could have, and what an impact other stories can have for so many who are suffering silently. If the viewers can relate to the pain and perhaps the experience, then it could save lives, as we will focus on prevention and positive outcomes. What I have learnt and I continue to learn in the space of mental health, mental illness and self-awareness is that all roads lead back to our mental wellbeing, how we look after ourselves and each other.
