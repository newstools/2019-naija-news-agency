For the second season in a row, Liverpool take on Napoli in the Champions League group phase. Last year, Napoli beat Liverpool 1-0 in Italy, while the Reds won 1-0 at Anfield. Of course, Liverpool went on to win the Champions League beating Tottenham in the final. Napoli and Liverpool also met in pre-season, as the Italians memorably beat the Reds 3-0. Ahead of Tuesday match in Naples, Jurgen Klopp confirmed that Andrew Robertson and Sadio Mane sustained knocks in Saturday’s 3-1 win over Newcastle. However, both Robertson and Mane are expected to be fully fit for the Napoli clash. Klopp told the Liverpool website: They all got [minor] knocks; Robbo got a knock, Sadio got a knock, but all are fine. Both Robertson and Mane played 90 minutes against Newcastle. Klopp started Belgian forward Divock Origi against the Magpies. However, Origi was subbed out the game for Roberto Firmino in the first half. That’s after Origi picked up an ankle injury against the Toon. Speaking after the game, Klopp said the following about Origi’s setback: Unfortunately, Div twisted his ankle early in the game and had to then come off. We all hope it is not that serious. That he could play on could be a sign it is not that serious, hopefully it is like this. I think he will have a scan today or whatever and then we will know more. Of course, that’s not cool, he is in really good shape, so hopefully they will not find a lot in the scan. After Newcastle took a shock lead through Jetro Willems, Liverpool won the match 3-1. Sadio Mane scored a first-half brace for the Reds. Mo Salah sealed the win with Liverpool’s third. In Italy, Napoli beat Sampdoria 2-0 at home on Saturday. Belgian forward Dries Mertens scored twice for Napoli. Also see: Watford vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions.
