Manchester United have this evening been handed a boost on the fitness front, with news that Daniel James has been included in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad to take on West Ham United. The Red Devils are set to travel to the London Stadium tomorrow afternoon, for their latest Premier League outing. United head into proceedings having put a disappointing streak of no wins in 3 firmly behind them over the last week. First off, a solitary Marcus Rashford strike saw the Manchester giants put Leicester City to the sword at Old Trafford last weekend. And one goal again proved enough for United in their Europa League curtain-raiser on Thursday night, with youngster Mason Greenwood having been the player on the scoresheet versus Kazakh outfit Astana. ⚽️ Mason Greenwood has become @ManUtd‘s youngest ever scorer in Europe 👏 🥇 @_MasonGreenwood 17y & 353d

Manuel Pellegrini’s men are unbeaten in 5 across all competitions, including 3-1 and 2-0 Premier League wins over Watford and Norwich respectively. And the Hammers’ hopes of carrying their solid early-season form beyond this weekend’s fixtures were boosted earlier this week, by updates on the fitness of a number of Manchester United’s key performers. Speaking on the back of his side’s victory over Astana, Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was questioned on the status of Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw, all of whom have been sidelined of late. And Solskjaer went on to confirm that the trio are set to miss out tomorrow: ‘Not really, no. They’ve not been training yet so I don’t think so.’ As such, news that another of United’s major doubts to feature versus West Ham has travelled with the club’s squad will no doubt come as a huge boost. The player in question is Daniel James. As confirmed across social media, Welsh wide-man James was spotted alongside the rest of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad set to make their way London this evening. Daniel James is part of the United travelling squad. The Welsh winger had been a slight doubt after picking up a knock in the win over Leicester City. #MUFC 🚑Table https://t.co/4KiAUTZjCa — Ben Dinnery (@BenDinnery) September 21, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Man United to open Paul Pogba contract talks – ESPN Source: Great Goals Updates on the fitness of a number of Manchester United stars have emerged online this afternoon, ahead of their meeting with West Ham United.
