With the pair set to go head-to-head over The Best Men’s Goalkeeper award, Ederson has stated that he thinks Alisson is a step ahead of both himself and Ter Stegen: “I think the three of us were the best, but I see Alisson one step ahead. “He was great in the Premier League, won the Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup and had a great Copa America as well. “So I think whoever wins will be deserving and I’m happy for two Brazilian goalkeepers to reach this level.” As quoted by Goal.
