West Ham youngster Declan Rice has claimed he has the ability to play for Manchester United, but the timing isn’t right for him to join an elite club. Rice has burst onto the scene at West Ham over the past two seasons. Back in the 2017/18 season, the 20-year-old featured 26 times for the Hammers in the Premier League. His performances were so impressive that he earned himself a starting role the year after, making 34 appearances in the English top-flight. So far this season, Rice has featured in all of West Ham’s Premier League fixtures. Now, he’s been speaking about his future and a potential step up in the future.

Despite that, Rice doesn’t plan to leave West Ham anytime soon. In fact, the midfielder knows that it’s not the right time for him to leave, with having ‘so much to learn’. “Don’t get me wrong, I think I’ve got the ability to play for a club like that. But it’s all about the timing and I don’t think the timing is right for me at all. I’ve still got so much to learn,” he told FourFourTwo when asked about Man United, as cited by football.london. “I’m loving it at West Ham, the connection between me and the supporters is special. I’ve become one of the fans’ favourites and the manager likes me. “It’s the best place for me to play my football.” Big games coming up #Euro2020 A post shared by  Declan Rice (@declanrice) on Aug 29, 2019 at 9:15am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Manchester United will go up against Leicester City this weekend and there’s some injury news.
