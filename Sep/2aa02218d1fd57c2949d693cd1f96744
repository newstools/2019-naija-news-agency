Chelsea have this evening been dealt a blow on the injury front, after Emerson was forced off during Italy‚Äôs clash with Finland. Roberto Mancini‚Äôs men travelled to the Ratina Stadium, for a Euro 2020 qualifying clash. The Azzurri headed into the matchup with a perfect record in Group J to this point, having picked up 5 wins from 5. The latest of these came this past Thursday, when Italy put Armenia to the sword by 3 goals to 1. The 4-time world champions, though, were no doubt aware that this evening‚Äôs clash would likely prove their toughest test to date, with Finland having notched wins in 4 of their 5 qualifiers thus far. The first-half in Tampere has since seen both sides stand firm, to head into the interval with the scoreline locked at 0-0. Visitors Italy, though, were dealt a blow on the injury-front with just 7 minutes on the clock. After making a lung-busting run back into his own half in an attempt to prevent a Finland break, Emerson pulled up with a muscle problem. The 25-year-old immediately signalled to the bench to take him out of the fray, with Alessandro Florenzi having been forced into a makeshift left-back role as Emerson‚Äôs replacement: #EuropeanQualifiers üèÜ 8‚Ä≤ #Mancini is forced into an early change as #Emerson can‚Äôt continue ‚§µÔ∏è#Florenzi comes on ‚§¥Ô∏è#FINITA 0-0#VivoAzzurro ‚Äî Italy (@azzurri) September 8, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Emerson just got injured on Italy duty.

Frank Lampard‚Äôs men are set to take on Wolves at Molineux next Saturday, in a Premier League clash. And, safe to say, fans of the Blues are not exactly excited by the prospect of Marcos Alonso returning to their side‚Äôs starting XI: Emerson off injured in the damn international break. F*ck an international break, honestly. I can‚Äôt do this Marcos Alonso dance again. ‚Äî Alex Goldberg (@AlexGoldberg_) September 8, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Emerson just got taken off for Italy with a hamstring / thigh injury meaning Marcos Alonso is likely to start for the next few weeks.. pic.twitter.com/x3KRFeTsU4 ‚Äî Pys (@CFCPys) September 8, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Update: Italy since took a second-half lead through Ciro Immobile, before in-form Norwich City hitman Teemu Pukki levelled from the penalty spot.
