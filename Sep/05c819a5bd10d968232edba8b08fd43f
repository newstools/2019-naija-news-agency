Emerson joined Chelsea in January of 2018 from Serie A outfit, AS Roma. The Blues are believed to have paid around £18m for Emerson’s services. However, despite being signed when Antonio Conte was Chelsea boss, the then Chelsea manager hardly played his new signing. In the second half of the 2017/18 season, Emerson made just five Premier League appearances, only three of which were as a starter. Emerson did play a bit more under Maurizio Sarri last campaign, managing 27 games across all competitions for Chelsea. However, Emerson still only made 10 Premier League outings under Sarri.

The 25-year-old appears to have usurped Marcos Alonso as the Blue’s main left-back as he has started all four of their PL games so far this season. Emerson also played the full 120 minutes for Chelsea in the 2019 European Super Cup vs Liverpool. With Lampard seemingly keen on the Italian, Chelsea look as though they are set to offer him a new deal. Emerson’s current Chelsea deal runs until July of 2022. However, according to Goal, the Blues are keen to tie Emerson down to a new deal before the January transfer window. The report from Goal claims Chelsea have already begun talks with the defender over a new contract. Emerson is currently on international duty with Italy.
