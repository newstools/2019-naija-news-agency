 After putting the Starboy FC on a long wait Wizkid finally dishes out “Joro“. The song got production service from the producer with a special vibe, Northboi. The Bass of this tune is banging which comes with some additional strings that can make you loose yourself from within. Wizkid sings for his Lady, asks her to Joro i.e dance. He serves her some sweet sweet Starboy vibe and melody that loosen her screw and got her dancing in no time. With his first single ‘Ghetto Love‘ still popping heavily, this record is also another special tune that will pull great numbers. ***Quotable Lyrics***
