French international Antoine Griezmann has lightheartedly suggested that his wife was to blame for his missed penalty versus Albania. Didier Deschamps’ men welcomed Albania to the Stade de France last night, for their latest Euro 2020 qualifier. The world champions headed into proceedings aware that nothing less than a win would do, amid a tightly-contested battle between Les Bleus, Turkey and Iceland atop the Group H table. And, in the end, France got the job done, by means of a comfortable 4-1 victory. A Kingsley Coman brace, either side of Olivier Giroud’s finish, put the hosts out of sight in Paris, before Nanitamo Ikone’s own goal added some gloss to the scoreline. Sokol Cikalleshi’s 90th-minute penalty, meanwhile, proved little more than a consolation for Albania. While one spot-kick was converted in last night’s clash, though, another was fluffed. With France 2-0 up and cruising, Les Bleus were awarded a 37th-minute penalty, with Antoine Griezmann having stepped up to take responsibility. The Barcelona hitman, though, crashed his ensuing effort off the crossbar, and back into play. As such, speaking in a post-match interview on the back of his side’s victory, Griezmann was questioned on his penalty miss. And the 28-year-old went on to provide a tongue-in-cheek excuse for his failure from the spot, revealing that his wife’s absence from the stadium may have been to blame: ‘I don’t know [what happened]. I don’t know.’ ‘As I said earlier, maybe it’s because my wife didn’t watch the game!’ ‘I was on a good dynamic but we can’t score every time. Too bad, I’ll have to work on it.’ Quotes via Goal France confirm Barcelona’s Umtiti will miss their game with Andorra Barcelona president Bartomeu on Neymar: ‘He’s not in the plans for January’ Source: Great Goals
