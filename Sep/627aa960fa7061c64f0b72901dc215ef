Today is Friday and I can feel your lips spreading into a smile as you get ready to turn up this weekend. Or maybe your plan is to rest your head at home. What matters is that there are top Naija songs you can listen to for your entertainment, whether at a party or within the enclosed walls of your room. Some of your faves including Wizkid, Naira Marley dropped interesting songs this week. We are getting closer to the end of the year and 2019 has seen several Nigerian artists release hit songs and quality content. Frankly, I’m impressed by the state of things in the Nigerian music industry. Our artists are making us proud and we are ready to continue showering them with all the support (and love) they can possibly need. As the week comes to an end, it is resoundingly important that we bring your attention to the interesting musical releases. Below is a list of top Naija songs that you should listen to this week. After several months of anticipation from his fans, Wizkid released his first single of the year Ghetto Love. The song came with the visuals and it is already topping music charts. Johnny Drille is easily one of the best singers and composers we have in the Nigerian music industry. His latest single Count on You is about a romantic relationship and the music video takes you on an emotional trip. It is now customary for Naira Marley to make lascivious songs and he follows in the same direction on his new single Puta. ‘Puta‘ is the Spanish word for prostitute. Just like the song, the video contains a lot of obscenities as well.  After featuring Runtown on the first version, Seyi Shay went ahead to collaborate with international act Teyena Taylor on the remix of Gimme Love and together they make a powerful combo.
