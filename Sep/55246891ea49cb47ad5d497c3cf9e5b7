 Nigerian recording artist, Yung6ix has promised to sue a jewellery company in the United States, saying he was a victim of racial profiling. In a video shared on his Instagram page, the rapper revealed that he had just been released from prison, after he was falsely accused of theft by a jewellery business owner identified as “Kay Jewelers”. Yung6ix also expressed his fears on if he would become the next black man to be mistreated by the system. He wrote: Was wrongfully accused by kays jewelers. Spent the last few hours wondering if I was gonna be another innocent black man getting f—k by the system. I’m going to be pressing charges for racial profiling #blacklivesmatter.
