 A few weeks ago, Kevin Hart and two other people in his car got involved in an accident. Good news!! Kevin Hart checked out of his inpatient rehab facility and is back home where he’s receiving intensive physical therapy but, he’s grateful and shocked to have survived the accident, TMZ reports. Kevin looked at the photos of the car crash and couldn’t believe anyone walked out alive. The ghastly accident messed up his back so bad that 3 spinal fractures required fusion. Kevin says, he’s grateful to be alive and has a new perspective on life. He really cherishes the fact that he’s alive, and wants to make the most of it in every way. The crash had a huge impact on him. Kevin who is known for always working out will be taking a break and he’s only doing physical therapist-approved exercises.
