On Wednesday, Man City posted an update on Aymeric Laporte. Laporte was injured in last weekendâ€™s match against Bournemouth in the Premier League. Sadly for the French centre-half, heâ€™s suffered a knee injury which has required surgery. Man City failed to outline a timeframe for when Laporte could return to action. ðŸš¨Injury update on @Laporteâ€¦ Everyone at City wishes Aymeric a full and speedy recovery. ðŸ”µ #mancity pic.twitter.com/Ifmtd4CqHJ â€” Manchester City (@ManCity) September 4, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js In the Times on Thursday, reporter Paul Hirst has clarified how long Laporte is likely to be out for: Aymeric Laporte will be out for at least four months with a knee injury. Laporte will miss at least 23 matches in total should he return at the earliest possibility in January. He will not be available for the entire Champions League group stage phase and the first Manchester derby of the season on December 7 as well as the fixtures against rivals Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal. Laporte's injury is not as bad as first feared, but he'll still be out until at least New Year, reports @hirstclass #MCFC https://t.co/p1d0odXEXu â€” Times Sport (@TimesSport) September 4, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js One question which has been floating about is who will Pep Guardiola now favour at centre-half. Nicolas Otamendi appears to be the first choice starter. However, John Stones and Fernandinho can both fill in in the second slot. For Paul Hirst, Stones appears to have the edge over the Brazilian: Guardiola is hopeful that Otamendi and Stones will be able to cope with the demands placed upon them, and he is also planning to play Fernandinho at centre back this season. Stones, 25, missed the last three games because of a thigh injury but Guardiola expects him to have recovered in time for Cityâ€™s next match against Norwich City on September 14. On a final point, the Times also report that Guardiola isnâ€™t planning on signing a centre-half this January. No reason is given for Man Cityâ€™s policy decision.
