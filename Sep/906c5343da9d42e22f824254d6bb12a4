The FA have confirmed that Jesse Lingard has been forced to pull out of the England squad, ahead of their meeting with Bulgaria. Gareth Southgateâ€™s men are set for a pair of Euro qualifiers over the coming days, starting tonight. The Three Lions will first take on Bulgaria at Wembley, in less than an hourâ€™s time. England will then welcome surprise group leaders Kosovo to London on Tuesday, after the minnows put the Czech Republic to the sword by 2 goals to 1 earlier today. Group A of Euro qualifying: England â€“ 4th in the world
Czech Republic â€“ 43rd in the world
Montenegro â€“ 55th in the world
