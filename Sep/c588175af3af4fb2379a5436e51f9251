A video is spreading on social media from Tuesday’s Carabao Cup tie between Portsmouth and Southampton. One Pompey supporter – a man, wearing a dark cap and a blue jumper – was filmed punching a police horse. It’s unclear how the confrontation started.

Back in 2013, during a derby against Sunderland, a Newcastle fan who was also filmed punching a police horse was jailed as a result. The Newcastle supporter was jailed for 12 months, while he was also banned from football for 6 years. In the end Southampton won the bragging rights in the south coast derby on Tuesday.

Ings doubled Southampton’s lead just before the break, while the Saints scored two late goals through Cedric Soares and Nathan Redmond.
