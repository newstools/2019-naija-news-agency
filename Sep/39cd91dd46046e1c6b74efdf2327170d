Round 6 of the Premier League kicks off on Friday night as Southampton take on Bournemouth. The two south coast sides sit side by side in the table. Bournemouth are 9th and Southampton are 10th: both sides have 7 points from 5 games, and a minus 1 goal difference. Ahead of the Southampton game, Eddie Howe has given a short update on Simon Francis and Lloyd Kelly. Both Kelly (ankle) and Francis (ACL knee) played more than an hour, respectively, on Tuesday night for Bournemouth U21s. Bournemouth thrashed Basingstoke Town 8-0, while Kelly was on the scoresheet. Speaking on Thursday to the press, Howe commented: We’re pretty much in the same place, added by the returns of Simon Francis and Lloyd Kelly in the week. The squad is getting stronger. The expectation is that Francis and Kelly won’t start against Southampton, but they could feature on the bench.

"He's highly thought of by @England and if he gets a good run of form then it's possible he could make the tournament squad."#SOUBOU // #afcb 🍒 pic.twitter.com/DOw7IxQa5R — AFC Bournemouth (@afcbournemouth) September 19, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Also see: Southampton vs Bournemouth betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions.
