Arsenal were handed their first defeat of the 2019/20 Premier League season on August 24th. Unai Emery took his side to Anfield and should have been hopeful of a much better result than the last time he was there with Arsenal. On December 29th, 2018, the Gunners were hammered 5-1 by Liverpool at Anfield. The performance this time around was overall a lot better from Arsenal. However, they would still come away with a 3-1 loss.

Ceballos has looked a solid addition to Arsenal’s squad and even earned two assists in one game vs Burnley. However, the Spaniard only managed 61 minutes in the Liverpool clash. When speaking about Liverpool, Ceballos stated that he had never seen a team play better or press better than Liverpool Ceballos goes on to mention how Liverpool suck the air out of you: “I had never seen anything like it. “I’ve not seen up until now a team that plays better, that presses better. That game had quite an impact on me. “They suck the air out of you. You spend so much time defending and when you want to catch your breath and get on the ball for a bit, they’ve taken it from you again. ” I think Jurgen [Klopp] now has the team he first had in mind when he started four years ago.” As quoted by the Daily Mail. Ceballos and Arsenal will no doubt be hoping for a much easier clash this weekend when they face bottom of the table Watford. 🇪🇸 International duty 🇪🇸⁠ ⁠ #Ceballos #Spain #internationals #Arsenal A post shared by  Arsenal Official (@arsenal) on Sep 6, 2019 at 3:55am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js See also: Sheffield United vs Southampton betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Manchester United vs Leicester City betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Liverpool vs Newcastle betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
