Neymar would join PSG in August of 2017 from FC Barcelona. However, the Brazilian hasn’t had the best time in Paris, partly due to his terrible injury luck. Neymar managed to play just 17 Ligue 1 games last campaign for PSG as he was dealing with a foot problem. For much of the summer, Neymar was being linked with a move away from the Parc de Princes. Barcelona were one of the more heavily linked sides. There was even a report that Barca had offered two players plush cash for their former star. However, when the European transfer window shut on September 2nd, Neymar was still a PSG player.

Bartomeu stated that Barca could not meet PSG’s demands this summer and also that Barca never offered players for Neymar, it was PSG that asked for them. The Barca president also claimed that Neymar isn’t in their plans for January: “He’s not in the plans for January. “Barcelona couldn’t meet PSG’s demands [this summer]. Barcelona never offered players for Neymar, it was PSG that asked for them. “We did everything possible to sign him.”It’s a fact that Neymar asked PSG to negotiate only with Barcelona. “The signing wasn’t easy, on a economic or social level.”[Lionel] Messi didn’t tell me to sign Neymar, that’s a myth. “The players don’t have a say in signings, it’s the sporting department, technical department and the directors who decide. “This year we prepared the squad very quickly. It’s a more competitive squad than last season, it’s smaller, 21 players, but very competitive.”And Ernesto Valverde knows the concept very well.” As quoted by Marca. Neymar is currently on international duty with Brazil.
