After losing to Valencia in their opening match in the Champions League, Chelsea face Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. Liverpool also lost on Tuesday in a 2-0 away defeat at Napoli. However, domestically Liverpool are the only perfect side in the division with five wins. Chelsea are sixth in the standings; the Blues are seven points behind the Reds already. Speaking in the mixed zone after Valencia, Tammy Abraham discussed the upcoming Liverpool match. The forward said that Chelsea hope to “put things right” after falling at Stamford Bridge. Abraham, who said he was “fuming” after Valencia, continued: (Sunday) is a test of character. We can take our anger out against Liverpool. It’s a massive game and both teams will be going to win. We’ll look forward to putting (tonight’s defeat) right. It’s still early doors (in the Champions League). We’re fuming we lost today. But there’s still five games to go – we just have to win our next five. He may not have scored in the Champions League, but Tammy Abraham has started the season superbly. Last weekend the forward scored a hat-trick in a 5-2 away win at Wolves. Abraham has seven goals in the Premier League. He leads the scoring charts along with Man City’s Sergio Aguero. The assumption is that Mount will miss the Liverpool game, however that’s not yet been confirmed.   ‘Mason’s got an ankle injury. He will have that assessed in the next 24 to 48 hours, and obviously we hope it’s not too bad.’ @FrankLampard #UCL #CFC #Chelsea A post shared by  Chelsea FC (@chelseafc) on Sep 17, 2019 at 3:26pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Also see: Frank Lampard confirms order of Chelsea’s penalty-takers before Liverpool after Ross Barkley’s miss.
