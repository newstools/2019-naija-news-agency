Former Arsenal star Nwankwo Kanu has criticised the Gunners’ board’s decision to allow Alex Iwobi to join Everton over the summer. Amid a hectic deadline day at the Emirates, Arsenal secured some long-overdue defensive reinforcements, in the form of the additions of both David Luiz and Kieran Tierney. There was also high-profile business on the departure front, though. On the back of rumours that Everton’s frustrations in their pursuit of Wilfried Zaha had seen the Toffees switch their attentions to Arsenal’s Alex Iwobi, Marco Silva’s men secured the Nigerian’s signature in the English transfer window’s closing hours. Iwobi put pen-to-paper on a 5-year deal at Goodison Park, in a move worth a reported £34 million. ✅ Creativity

Speaking in an interview with Goal.com earlier today, Gunners legend Kanu revealed his opinion that his fellow countryman’s Arsenal roots make him precisely the type of player who should be present in Unai Emery’s squad: ‘I would say they made a mistake, 100 per cent. Why they let him go, I don’t know.’ ‘He’s a boy who, in and out, is Arsenal. He always wanted to do his best for the club. He loves the club, but not only that he can play football.’ ‘What he brings week in, week out, the fans need to appreciate that.’ LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 01: Alex Iwobi of Everton celebrates scoring his teams second goal during the Premier League match between Everton FC and Wolverhampton Wanderers at Goodison Park on September 01, 2019 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.
