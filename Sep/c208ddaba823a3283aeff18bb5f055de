After going two transfer windows without signing a single first-team player, Tottenham finally brought in some fresh legs this summer. One of those players was Giovani Lo Celso. Lo Celso has moved on loan to Tottenham from Real Betis but Spurs are believed to have an option to buy him next summer. Lo Celso has featured in three of Tottenham’s Premier League games this season. However, he has yet to start a league game, playing just 44 minutes of Premier League football.

Argentina took on Chile in a friendly with the game ending 0-0. After the game, Argentina have reported that Lo Celso suffered an injury vs Chile. Lo Celso is said to have injured his left inguinal region (groin). #SelecciónMayor Parte médico: Giovani Lo Celso sufrió un golpe en la región inguinal izquierda. — Selección Argentina 🇦🇷 (@Argentina) September 6, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Argentina didn’t say how bad the injury was or how long they think Lo Celso could be out for but Spurs will likely be hoping it is nothing too serious. Tottenham’s first game back after the current international break is at home to Crystal Palace on September 14th. On his injury vs Chile, Lo Celso reportedly said this: “My problem – left groin injury – was only a blow. It is not something to worry about.” Lo Celso eases injury fears after he was forced off during #ARG friendly with Chile after 53 minutes. “My problem – left groin injury – was only a blow.
