Former Manchester United star Gary Neville has today provided his take on the possibility of Declan Rice making the move to Old Trafford. Versatile 20-year-old Rice is generally deployed as a defensive midfielder, but can also line-out as a central-defender when required. After showcasing his massive potential across 26 Premier League appearances for West Ham during the 2017/18 season (15 starts), Rice subsequently went on to cement himself as an integral member of Manuel Pellegrini’s midfield throughout last season. The teen started in 34 of the Irons’ 38 league outings, earning rave reviews for his performances versus the likes of Tottenham, Newcastle and Arsenal: 🍾 Man of the Match, @WestHamUtd’s Declan Rice

Special way to top it off getting my full competitive debut tonight in such a great performance from all the lads. Already looking forward to the summer 🦁🦁🦁 pic.twitter.com/ysSJuvNB6a — Declan Rice (@_DeclanRice) March 25, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As such, recent reports that a number of the Premier League’s giants have set their sights firmly on Rice’s signature have come as little surprise. The likes of Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United have all been named as keen admirers of the starlet’s talents.

The individual in question, in the form of Gary Neville, however, revealed his opinion that, though the youngster ‘could potentially develop into something fantastic’ for the coming decade, he does not see Rice as the player that Manchester United need at this moment in time: ‘I mean you talk about £80m, £90m to get him out of West Ham.’ ‘We’ve seen a bid for [Wilfried] Zaha go to Everton this year for £70m. To get players out of the likes of West Ham now, Crystal Palace, it is not going to be easy. It is going to cost a fortune.’ ‘Would I say yes now at 80 million, 90 million? I’m not feeling that personally at this moment in time, but am I seeing a really good player who could potentially develop into something fantastic for the next 10 years? Yes. I really do think that.’ ‘But do United need another player? They’ve already got [Nemanja] Matic, they’ve already got [Scott] McTominay who are doing a similar role to what I see Rice doing.’ “He is going to cost £80-£90million”@GNev2 reacts to being asked if he would take Declan Rice at Manchester United pic.twitter.com/mJIboujEBk — Sky Sports MNF (@SkySportsMNF) September 16, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Official: David De Gea commits future to Man United with new deal Man United will try to sign James Maddison & Leicester’s price tag revealed – Times Source: Great Goals A future Old Trafford star?
