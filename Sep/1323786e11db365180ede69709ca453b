Leicester City star James Maddison last night brilliantly replied to the Sun newspaper on social media, after the British publication took aim at the midfielder over his dress sense. Brendan Rodgersâ€™ Foxes welcomed Tottenham to the King Power Stadium yesterday, in Saturdayâ€™s early Premier League kick-off. Visitors Spurs headed into proceedings in search of an immediate bounce-back showing, having blown a 2-0 advantage at Olympiacos in their Champions League opener during the week, to eventually slump to a 2-2 draw. When all was said and done, however, the capital outfit failed to get back on track. A back-and-forth affair saw Tottenham take the lead on the half-hour mark, when Harry Kane did brilliantly to take the ball under control, before finding the top corner of Kasper Schmeichelâ€™s goal. Leicester, however, showcased their fighting spirit as the clash wore on, to work their way back into things. And, after what looked set to be a 3-point clinching strike from Serge Aurier was ruled out by VAR, Leicester quickly pulled level, courtesy of Ricardo Pereira. The stopperâ€™s strike saw the King Power reinvigorated, with the hosts having made use of the raucous atmosphere inside the ground to eventually go on to bag a crucial winner, via James Maddison. 31 â€“ James Maddison ended a run of 31 shots in the Premier League without a goal, since netting versus Huddersfield in April.
