Italy boss Roberto Mancini has moved to assure that the injury picked up by Emerson versus Finland was ‘nothing serious’. The Azzurri travelled to the Ratina Stadium last night, for a Euro 2020 qualifying clash. Italy headed into the matchup with a perfect record in Group J, having picked up 5 wins from 5. And the 4-time world champions’ stellar qualification record only improved in Tampere 24 hours ago, as they ran out eventual 2-1 victors. On the back of a goalless first-half, things heated up following the interval. Ciro Immobile opened the game’s scoring just short of the hour mark, before in-form Norwich City hitman Teemu Pukki levelled things up from the penalty spot 15 minutes later. Italy, though, showcased their fighting spirit during the matchup’s closing stages, to eventually bag a winner. After being awarded a highly-controversial spot-kick of their own 10 minutes from time, Jorginho stepped up to slot home. An otherwise positive night’s work for the Azzurri, though, was soured somewhat by a blow on the injury front. The player to have picked up the problem was Emerson, with the stopper having been forced to limp off with just 8 minutes on the clock: #EuropeanQualifiers 🏆 8′ #Mancini is forced into an early change as #Emerson can’t continue ⤵️#Florenzi comes on ⤴️#FINITA 0-0#VivoAzzurro — Italy (@azzurri) September 8, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As such, fears quickly spread amongst the Chelsea faithful, with Emerson’s muscle problem having placed him in immediate doubt to feature versus Wolves this weekend. Italy boss Roberto Mancini, though, has since moved to quell concerns over the 25-year-old. Speaking following his side’s latest win, Mancini assured that Emerson’s problem is not a serious one, adding that the Chelsea man left the pitch purely as a precautionary measure: ‘It was nothing serious. He stopped to ensure it didn’t get any worse.’ Quotes via Football-Italia Jorginho’s agent confirms plans to remain at Chelsea ‘for at least another four years’ Chelsea expect to do transfer business in January – Mirror Source: Great Goals
