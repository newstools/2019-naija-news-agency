 TopBoy superstar and International disc Jockey, Spinall teams up with Reminisce Alaga (The OG) for his third official 2019 single – “EDI“. This record is a follow up to the previous release with Wizkid and Tiwa Savage – ‘Dis Love‘, which still currently one of the hottest summer jam and buzzing on speakers and different charts. The new song is a good party starter with banging production from Calis Da Kapentar and Spinall himself. Remmy Alaga Ibile didn’t waste the beat as he serves his blazing indigenous flow that will burst like Oja.
