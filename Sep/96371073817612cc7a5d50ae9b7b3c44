Phyno and Davido‘s new song “Ride For You” is a mid tempo love song with quality production from SourLarge. This record appreciates the caring ladies that stays firm with their man through thick and thin. Phyno says now that he has made it he is ready to pay anything for his lover’s bride price and spoil her with all he got because she was the only one that held me down and supported when there was nothing (No Raba). Davido also comes into to compliment his woman who has always got his back. This song is a must listen, the message is powerful and the tune is topnotch. **Quotable Lyrics**
