In a month’s time, when the next round of international fixtures come around, Switzerland could be without Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka. Xkaha is expecting to become a father in October, and he’s confirmed to Swiss paper Blick that he’s set to take some off: There are more special things in life than football. For example, when you become a father. With Haris (Seferovic, who just became a dad) it was agreed that he gives everything against Ireland and then he’d travel home. And with me, it would probably fall on that time when we play.   👶🏻❤️ A post shared by  Granit Xhaka (@granitxhaka) on Jul 26, 2019 at 1:01pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Switzerland are currently third in Group D following a 1-1 draw in Ireland on Saturday.
