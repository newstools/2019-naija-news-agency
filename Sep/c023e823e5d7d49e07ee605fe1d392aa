Premier League giants Spurs have this afternoon confirmed the extent of the injury picked up by summer signing Giovani Lo Celso. On the back of a lengthy saga, Argentine midfielder Lo Celso made the move to north London last month. The 23-year-old joined Tottenham from La Liga outfit Real Betis, on loan until the end of the season. Lo Celso has since largely-struggled for game-time, though, as he continues to adapt to the rigours of English football. The goal-scoring midfielder has managed appearances in Spursâ€™ last 3 Premier League outings, but for a grand total of just 44 minutes.

The Albicelesteâ€™s first outing, versus the former, ended in a 0-0 stalemate last Friday. Lo Celso was handed a starting berth in his countryâ€™s midfield but, unfortunately for both Argentina and Spurs, was eventually forced off through injury. It was subsequently reported that the South American had picked up a groin problem, with Tottenham fearing an extended period on the sidelines: #thfc Spurs fear Lo Celso suffered serious groin injury on international duty.

As per Tottenhamâ€™s official website, Lo Celso has in fact picked up a hip problem, which is expected to keep him out of action until the end of next month: â€˜Giovani Lo Celso has returned early to Hotspur Way after being withdrawn from the Argentina squad due to a hip injury.â€™ â€˜The attacking midfielder sustained the injury during his national teamâ€™s match against Chile. He will now undergo a period of rehabilitation and is expected to return to training with the first team towards the end of October.â€™ ðŸ“° An injury update on @LoCelsoGiovani.#THFC âšª #COYS â€” Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) September 10, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Tottenham reportedly ready to reignite Paulo Dybala pursuit in January Agent of Romaâ€™s Nicolo Zaniolo confirms Spurs summer interest Source: Great Goals
