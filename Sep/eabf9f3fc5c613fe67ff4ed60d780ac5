 It seems the silent rivalry between Tiwa Savage and Yemi Alade is coming to an end, and we might get a collaboration possibly. During her #4999 Listening Party in London, she was quizzed about collaborating with female artistes and she went to calling Yemi Alade and describing her latest album “Woman of Steel” as incredible. Savage also mentioned Simi, Niniola, Waje, Omawumi, Teni and more; and called for females to break boundaries take over the male-dominated music space. Tiwa Savage also went ahead to share Yemi Alade’s album on Instagram, which Yemi re-shared. So it seems, the duo is in a good space, probably texting and we might that power female anthem and we are here for it. All the receipts below!    The post What Beef?
