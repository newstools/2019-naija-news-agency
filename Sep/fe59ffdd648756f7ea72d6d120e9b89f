Leandro Trossard joined Brighton over the summer from Belgian outfit, Genk. Brighton are believed to have paid around £18m for Trossard’s services. Trossard was an unused sub in the Seagull’s first Premier League game of the season vs Watford. However, the 24-year-old has since started Brighton’s proceeding three league outings. Trossard has scored once in those three ties, earning his side a 1-1 draw with West Ham United.

Belgium are currently top of Group I after playing four games. They have won all four ties, scoring 11 and conceding just one in the process. Belgium’s first game of the break is against San Marino on Friday evening. Prior to facing off with San Marino, Belgium have confirmed that Trossard has suffered a groin injury in a training session. Belgium go on to state that Trossard will miss both Friday’s clash with San Marino and then their following game vs Scotland, which takes place on Monday the 9th of September. @LTrossard quit today’s training due to a groin injury. He is out for tomorrow and the @ScotlandNT game #EURO2020 #SMRBEL #SCOBEL — Belgian Red Devils (@BelRedDevils) September 5, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Brighton will likely be hoping the injury sustained by Trossard is nothing serious and he can be fit for their first game back after the break. The Seagulls will play host to Sean Dyche’s Burnley side on September 14th.
