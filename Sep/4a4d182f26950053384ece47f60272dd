BBC Sport have on Tuesday the 10th of September reported that Everton central defender Yerry Mina has been fined ¬£10,000 and warned as to his future conduct after admitting breaching Football Association betting rules. The issue arose when Mina appeared in a TV advert for Colombian betting company, Betjuego. According to the report from the BBC, the FA called the case unusual and recognise the strong mitigation put forward by both Everton and Mina himself. The BBC report also lists Mina‚Äôs mitigating factors as: The advert was entirely in Spanish. It was not broadcast outside of Colombia and was removed as soon as Mina realised he had broken betting rules. Mina did not profit from the advert ‚Äì his fee was donated to the Yerry Mina Foundation He admitted the charge at the earliest opportunity and apologised for his mistake. On the fine, the FA stated that a warning alone would not be sufficient enough to reflect the seriousness of such a breach. ‚ÄúA warning alone would be insufficient to reflect the seriousness of such a breach given that the integrity of the game is potentially threatened by breaches of the FA‚Äôs betting rules.‚Äù As quoted by BBC Sport.
