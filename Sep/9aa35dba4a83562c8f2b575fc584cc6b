Chelsea and Liverpool are set to go head-to-head on Sunday for the second time this season. The first time the two sides faced off this campaign was for the European Super Cup with Liverpool eventually coming out on top. Liverpool head into this tie having won their opening five Premier League ties, the only side to do so this season. As for Chelsea, they are yet to keep a clean sheet under Frank Lampard this season.

During said press conference, Klopp gave updates on Naby Keita, Alisson and Divock Origi. Klopp confirmed that Keita is back in training with the team today (Friday). The German also stated that Alisson is making ‘big progress’ but the Brazilian is not in team training yet. Finally, Klopp mentioned that Origi is unlikely to be fit for the Chelsea tie but Klopp wouldn’t rule the forward out: “Naby Keita is back in training at least, with the team. Today for the first time with the team. “Ali is making big progress, but is still away. He had a proper session yesterday with John Achterberg, but is not in team training yet. “Div, we have to see day by day, that’s how it was from the first day – how can he deal with the pain and stuff like that. We will see. It is pretty early, so I don’t know exactly what the medical department will tell me [today] about that case. “I think it’s unlikely [he will be fit for Chelsea] but why should I rule him out? But it’s unlikely.” As quoted by Liverpool’s official website.
