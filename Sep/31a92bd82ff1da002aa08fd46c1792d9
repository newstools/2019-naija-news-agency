 Deciding on a foundation formula can be pretty tricky and as usual, BN Beauty is out here trying to make your life easier – one beauty solution at a time. We took a day out with the Beauty Revolution and Essenza teams to try out the Estee Lauder iMatch tool. Why? Shade selection is a real pain point for many of our BellaStylistas and when we heard there was a beauty technology to solve this, we jumped at the chance to give it a whirl!   Raise your hand like this☝️ if you still don’t know what your UNDERTONE is!!..lol.. (If you raised your hand or thought of raising your hand then this post is for you!..read on) So I finally got to know my Undertone on Friday thanks to @esteelauder @beautyrevolutionstudio @essenza_ng @beautybar_essenza and I also found my #Perfectmatch in the Estee Lauder Double wear foundation line. (I am in the shade “5N1 Amber Honey” just incase!) Yes I am Neutral!. For years I thought I was Warm, and was wondering why I looked orange sometimes🙈.. But now I have it figured out, And you can know yours too..If you are free just stop by at the @beautybar_essenza in The Palms Shopping Mall and get your shade matched right girl get your #perfectimatch, it literally takes like 5seconds!!.. and when you do, feel free to ask for a free Foundation sample!!.. I used the word free twice in one sentence lol, and I am smiling at the moment.😁😁 Stop looking orange, green, red and ashy like I used too🤣!, before I forget!….We did a Transfer test on a white shirt!! I was cringing, But yo!, NOTHING!…NOTHING TRANSFERED… I was shocked🤯!! I am going to have a review an the @esteelauder doublewear foundation, and do transfer test and maybe even try out a 24 hours test. It would be up by Wednesday. So if you want to know how it applies in HD and ofcourse the Tea and product details!!. You know where to be!!. Its a date..lol. @t.alamodebeauty @lagoscitychic @mercyfamilusi see how beautiful you all looked!!!.. — #EsteelauderNigeria #esteelauder #Esteepartner #kelechimgbemena #wearconfidence #perfectimatch #doubleware # A post shared by  𝐊𝐄𝐋𝐄𝐂𝐇𝐈 | 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟 🎥 (@kelechimgbemena) on Sep 23, 2019 at 1:54pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Led by our very own Mary Edoro, as well as beauty influencer Kelechi Mgbemena and celebrity makeup artist Tito Ibeleme. We hung out at Essenza Beauty Bar in the Palms to put the claims to the test. Our mission: To figure out our perfect foundation shade and trial Estee Lauder’s best selling Doublewear Foundation and iMatch tool.  While indulging in sweet treats, we got the low-down on the best-selling Double Wear Stay-in-Place foundation that’s oil-free, long-wearing and transfer-resistant. The Essenza team gave us a quick overview of how the tool works and then used it to identify our skin tones and the perfect foundation for each person.  The team was super knowledgeable and the process takes into consideration your skin type, what you want from your foundation, the type of coverage and finish you prefer. Mary was 5N1.5 Maple (Neutral), Kelechi was 5N1 Amber Honey and Tito was 7W1 Deep Spice (Warm/Golden). We think the iMatch tool will be particularly helpful if you’re new to the Estee Lauder foundations and need assistance finding your exact shade.  As you can imagine we had a super time trying this out and we can’t wait to try our new foundation (PS: Did we mention its transfer-proof? Estee Lauder Doublewear foundation also comes in 55 shades and will definitely  else the day may throw at you.) The iMatch system is available at Estee Lauder counters at Essenza Beauty Bar at the Palms Mall in Lekki, Lagos, and Essenza in Jabi Lake Mall Abuja.  Annoying issues like a mismatch between how the foundation looks in the bottle versus how it shows up on your skin are now a thing of the past, thanks to the Estee Lauder iMatch tool… About Estee Lauder Founded by Estée Lauder, the world’s first female entrepreneur, the brand continues her legacy of creating the most innovative, sophisticated, high-performance skin care and makeup products and iconic fragrances — all infused with a deep understanding of women’s needs and desires.
