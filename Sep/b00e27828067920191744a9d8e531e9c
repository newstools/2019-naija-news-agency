Comedian Bovi Ugboma has shared video number 2 out of the eight prank videos he promised to release as a count down to his 40th birthday. Bovi set the internet on fire on Thursday when he posted a video pranking one of his friends with his wife Kris Asimonye-Ugboma . In this video, Kris calls one of his friends in Warri to ask about Boviâ€™s whereabouts and as expected, the friend covered for him. He also mentioned that some of his friends have been begging him not to release their videos but he says heâ€™s not stopping anytime soon. Watch the video below:   Boys will always be boys. No matter what. And to those begging me not to release their tapes, Iâ€™m sorry.
