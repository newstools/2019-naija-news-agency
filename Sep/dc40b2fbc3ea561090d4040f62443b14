Meet Toronto based Kaela Kay – an Ankara fusion and print brand with North American and Ghanaian heritage. Why did you start your line ? I wanted to merge my Ghanaian roots with my North American upbringing in fashion; by using the Ankara prints (in Ghana we call it Ntoma) to design modern and classy pieces for a modern generation. Who is your favourite celebrity or influencer to work with? Bozoma Saint John because she really embodies the qualities of a Kaela Kay woman – confident, classy, outgoing and fabulous. I haven’t yet, but I would love to dress Michelle Obama. What do you believe should be the foundation of every woman’s wardrobe? Self-expression. Style is such an individual and unique way for expression and every woman should build her wardrobe based on her personality. We may wear the same article of clothing but it should look different and unique. Who is the Kaela Kay woman? Any woman (no matter size, shape, cultural background) who loves bold, bright, classy pieces; a woman who is looking for creative pieces to add to her wardrobe to accentuate her style and isn’t afraid to stand out. Where do you get style inspiration? Almost everything around me! From art to people around me. I don’t focus on fashion trends – rather what are women talking about wanting to wear or needing to wear; what styles will still be appropriate and wearable in a few years. Where can we purchase pieces from the brand? www.kaelakay.com; flag ship Toronto boutique at 857 Wilson Ave, North York, Ontario Canada. Kutula in Los Angeles  Are you a fan of Kaela Kay ?
