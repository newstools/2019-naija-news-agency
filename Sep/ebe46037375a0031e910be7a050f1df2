During said press conference Smith would provide an update on his squad. Smith gave updates on three players, firstly confirming that Jonathan Kodjia is absent but in light training. Smith also confirmed Matt Targett is in contention to start while James Chester  is training but has yet to play a full game for Villa, something Smith says they will look to arrange over the next few weeks: “Only Jonathan Kodjia is absent. He’s in light training and doing non-contact bits for at least a few weeks. “Other than that, I have a fit squad. Matt Targett is in contention to start and be in the squad. “James Chester still hasn’t played in a full game for us, so we’ll look to arrange that over the next few weeks. But he’s training every time.” As quoted by Aston Villa’s official website.   We see you, @JamesChester23. .
