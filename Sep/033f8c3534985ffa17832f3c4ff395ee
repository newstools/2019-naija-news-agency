On Wednesday, Liverpool goalie Alisson has spoken to Spanish daily Marca in a fresh interview. Alisson is currently on the sidelines at Anfield. The Brazilian stopper suffered an injury in Liverpool’s opening game of the season against Norwich. Adrian, signed on a free this summer, is now playing between the sticks for the Reds. Marca asked the Liverpool goalie if he thinks he could be in the running to win the Ballon d’Or. Alisson replied: I have read some news and I am proud, but I know it is not easy. It is even more difficult for a goalkeeper. But I also have a clear conscience. This means that I am doing my job well and people value it. Alisson then revealed his thoughts on how people value goalies in modern football: The difference is that the goalkeeper does not score goals. We stop them [laughs]. People like to celebrate goals. It is the most important moment in football. And I think that’s why the strikers stand out a little more. It’s a natural thing, but little by little things are changing.  Great moment! #AB1 #Godisgood 🤩🏆 A post shared by  Alisson Becker (@alissonbecker) on Aug 29, 2019 at 3:02pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js The Brazilian goalie also spoke about Liverpool’s chances of winning the league. Without mentioning Man City by name, Alisson said: We are going to fight for all the titles, but there are other very strong teams who also have the same goals as Liverpool. There is much to aspire to; both with Liverpool and Brazil. We have several collective goals and I also have individual goals. I still have a lot to achieve and hopefully this season is as good as the last. The Liverpool stopper was also asked to name his best ever save. Alisson answered: It is difficult to choose one moment, but I think the most important for me was against Napoli at Anfield, against [Arkadiusz] Milik, in the final minutes of the last phase of the Champions League groups. Alisson: “The ball went to Milik, he stopped the ball and I just tried to close the gaps, close the space. “I think that happened in that moment, the ball came through me. I think I’m blessed as well – a bit lucky!”pic.twitter.com/oVAU3ePO0h — Anfield Watch (@AnfieldWatch) July 2, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Also see: Arsenal, Chelsea & Tottenham: 25-man Premier League squads confirmed.
