Christian Eriksen has been at Tottenham since 2013. In that time he has played 281 games, scored 67 and assisted 86 across all competitions for Spurs. However, Eriksen may have surprised some Tottenham fans back in June when he said in an interview that he may want to try something new. In that same interview, Eriksen also spoke about Real Madrid, labeling them a ‘step up’. What proceeded was Eriksen being linked with several clubs over the summer including Real Madrid, Manchester United and Atletico Madrid.

The Dane didn’t start Spurs’ first league game of the season vs Aston Villa but he did come on as a sub and Tottenham looked a much better side with him on the pitch. Eriksen has since featured in Tottenham’s proceeding three games, scoring the opening goal in Spurs’ 2-2 draw with Arsenal this past Sunday. Harry Winks has now recently spoken about Eriksen and him staying. When asked if the Tottenham squad was relieved that Eriksen had stayed, Winks stated: “Yes, of course. Christian’s a fantastic player, there’s no doubt about that. “He’s been one of our most impressive performers over the last few years. Christian’s a top person and whatever he decides, that’s up to him. “All we can say is how well he’s performed for us this season and how professional he is. He’s fantastic.” As quoted by the Evening Standard.
