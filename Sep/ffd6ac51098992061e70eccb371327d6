Paul Parker has today revealed his opinion that Manchester United made the correct decision in allowing both Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez to depart the club. Amid a transfer window filled with rumours surrounding some of the star attackers plying their trade at Old Trafford, Lukaku and Sanchez secured respective departures over the course of the last couple of months. First, hitman Lukaku joined Serie A giants Inter Milan, in a £73 million deal: 🚨 | BIG ANNOUNCEMENT@RomeluLukaku9 è un giocatore dell’Inter! 🇧🇪⚫🔵 👉🏻 https://t.co/OPIzhuG3F6#WelcomeRomelu #NotForEveryone #FCIM pic.twitter.com/zoPO8QCo8A — Inter (@Inter) August 8, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js And Sanchez soon followed suit, joining teammate Lukaku at the San Siro. The Chilean’s move, though, came in the form of a loan: 🛑 | EVERYONE STOP 🥂 @Alexis_Sanchez is a Nerazzurri player! 🇨🇱⚫🔵 👉🏻 https://t.co/4mJAFMukTV#WelcomeAlexis #NotForEveryone #FCIM pic.twitter.com/zJ0jyuhG99 — Inter (@Inter_en) August 29, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js United’s decision to allow both Lukaku and Sanchez to depart, though, has since been called into question by some. An injury crisis up top currently sees the Red Devils without Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood, while Marcus Rashford limped off during a 2-0 defeat to West Ham yesterday afternoon. One individual, however, who feels as though Lukaku and Sanchez had to go, is former United star Paul Parker. Speaking on the We Are The Busby Boys podcast earlier today, Parker, who plied his trade at Old Trafford from 1991 to 1996, explained: ‘The problem is when you have a long term plan, you can only go as far as the people above will allow, so you have to also work with the short term in mind.’ ‘He [Solskjaer] wanted Lukaku to go, and he would have liked a replacement, but as we know he wasn’t allowed to [sign one].’ ‘As far as Sanchez goes, if he’d kept him and not used him, or he’d have got injured, or if he’d kept him and used him and his performances continued to dip, he would have been slaughtered for not getting him out.’ ‘I think in the long term it’s still absolutely right.’ Parker went on to reveal his opinion that Lukaku disrespected the club’s badge with his behaviour, ahead of his move to Inter Milan: ‘With Sanchez they’ve been able to get rid of a portion of the money and there was obviously an issue with Lukaku, an attitude problem and the way he conducted himself didn’t help, he disrespected the badge on the shirt.’ ‘It’s the long game he looked at and in my opinion it’s to the benefit of the dressing room.’ Jose Mourinho claims David De Gea was ‘lucky’ to be handed lucrative new Man United deal Source: Great Goals
