 When it comes to African fashion, two of the biggest players are undeniably Bonang Matheba and Rich Mnisi. Both trailblazers, both revolutionaries changing what the African fashion industry is right now and both using their platforms to tell their authentic African stories. Using his eponymous menswear brand, Rich Mnisi has utterly redefined menswear in South Africa and Africa. Pushing boundaries as they’ve never before, Rich Mnisi has set a new standard for menswear and experimental fashion. Bonang Matheba, on the hand, is a living personification of pushing expectations and doing it all. From successful business startups to serving some of the best looks from the continent, Bonang is literally one of the best of Africa’s fashion talents at the moment. This makes both of them a perfect fit for Glamour SA’s Fashion Issue. Covering the issue where they are photographed by South African visual artist, these powerhouses give us an insight into what it is like to redefine the African fashion industry.
