Eden Hazard’s 2018/19 season was perhaps his best in a Chelsea shirt. The Belgian netted 16 and assisted 15 in the Premier League last campaign. After such an outstanding season Hazard then made the switch to Spanish giants Real Madrid over the summer. Madrid are believed to have paid an initial fee of £88.5m for Hazard’s services.

The former Chelsea man picked up a thigh problem last month just before the start of the La Liga season. As well as Hazard, Madrid have some other pretty big names currently out of action such as  Isco and Marco Asensio. But there is some good news for the Los Blancos faithful on the Eden Hazard front.

The report from the ES speculates that Hazard could make his debut next Saturday vs Levante. Madrid have not had the best of starts to the new campaign. They are undefeated in their first three La Liga outings of the new season. However, Zinedine Zidane’s side drew two of those games, the latest of which being against Villarreal.
