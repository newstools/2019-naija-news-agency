Summer might be over but the hints of warm weather in Biggie’s House has the Pepper Dem Gang in summer mode – and nothing says summer mode like a pool party. When it comes to fun in the sun or should we say fun at night, the Housemates sure know how to host celebrations as well as they know how to have fun – well, thanks to Diane for being the mastermind behind this. With pool floats on deck and the finest swimsuits, here’s how the Pepper Dem Gang threw the best pool party. The anticipation even kept Twitter buzzing with the hashtag, #Diane’sPoolParty. Go, girl! The Sizzling Costumes Trust the Pepper Dem ladies to come through with feisty looks whenever the need arises. From Mercy to Diane, Khafi and Cindy, the ladies kept us glued to our screens all through their party. Even the likes of Tacha and Mike who didn’t participate in the activities did not fail to pepper us with their pool wears. Did you all see Diane on them bikini 🔥😍 #BBNajia #BBNaija #DianeSplashParty — Sir LanceLot 🔰 𓄁𓃠𓆉𓅿𓃰𓃟𓆏 (@lord_omo) September 13, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Food and Everything Nice The Housemates thought they had everything sorted out as they spent the afternoon preparing food and planning their party just before the Arena Games. Little did they know that Biggie knows and hears all, on this note, Big Brother provided grills, drinks and pool games for his guests. The moment he told the Housemates to stop cooking and get ready to receive his treats, the screams let us in on how excited and enthusiastic they were. Thank you, Biggie! Even the viewers stayed up to turn up with the Pepper Dem Gang. Big Brother really came through for Diane!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Im so happy for diane! #bbnaija #DianeSplashParty pic.twitter.com/ROm9wyo6rP — LamborginiMercy (@BanziNondu) September 13, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The Playoffs From the water guns provided by Biggie to the carefully drafted games by Diane, the Housemates had a blast at the pool, of course with the infusion of dance moves and Khafi’s popping red lipstick. The Spectators They got ready, grabbed a plate of food and with drinks in their hands, Mike, Tacha and Ike walked into the Garden and had their own private party in the “danfo” prop. As they analyzed the game and gossiped about their fellow Housemates, Ike, Elozonam, Mike and Tacha kept us entertained, even as onlookers. Chills In The Dialo Ship Just before the pool party came to an end, Elozonam opened up to Tacha, Ike and Mike about how bad Diane made him feel in the relationship. According to him, Diane was making him feel stupid in front of the world with her constant mention of a certain celebrity crush, “MG”. Although it wasn’t revealed who the initials belong to but it was quite evident how the mention of the name hurt Elozonam so much. It took the intervention of Ike, Mercy and Seyi to get the couple talking again and the moment Diane ran to the Garden to lay her head on Elozonam’s chest, it was clear that the two definitely have uncovered feelings for each other. #Dialo shippers it’s all good, our ship is still sailing, it was just a little storm #BBNaija pic.twitter.com/aPb2uRQls4 — Gaga (@GaGaBilLz) September 14, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js What a night it has been… Different emotions experienced at one go #BBNaija pic.twitter.com/hKtGNX3OWn — 💔RIPThami💔 (@Lolly_funk) September 14, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Will this be the end of the Dialo ship or will this seemingly big fight be the beginning of a beautiful relationship?

Check out the times the Pepper Dem Gang were super excited in the Big Brother Naija House. We have our energetic time, the moment we are extremely excited about certain things. It’s the same way we have our low moments, when we are down and feel like quitting. But in this article, we have packed together all the Housemates’ high moments. In Biggie’s House, here are the Pepper Demons Gang’s Highest Moments. Seyi We all know what Seyi has become since his return from the fake Eviction. Who doesn’t like being recognised? When Seyi became the Head of House the second time, it fell on the week of the Heritage Bank’s Tor Tiv ceremony. As the HoH, he got bespoke attention such as never been given any other Housemates. Besides the coronation ceremony which saw a traditional dance troupe perform, a reception was also organised in his honour. Come and look at Seyi throughout the day. If it was possible to see his heart, we could tell his joy knew no bound. He was all smiles all day. Khafi When you have never owned a thing before and you happened to win it on a platter of gold, how would you feel? Extremely happy right? Of course. We know the resident cup of khafi is full of life any day. But her liveliness was a step further when she won the Innoson car. Guys, we believe you would do more if the first time you will get your first car, it was handed over to you as a winning prize, no dime paid. Khafi was so happy that day, it was a surprise she did not shed tears. Mike As the cruise man, Mike is always filled with positive energy in the House. Whether during Tasks or at the Saturday Night Party, he never stops to show us that he is in the House to catch fun. So when Jidenna visited the House, his face shone with joy. When he introduced himself, he did it with vigour. This appears to be his happiest moments. Tacha Did you also see the excitement on Tacha’s face the moment she and Seyi returned to the House from the secret room? She was looking all glam up with her outfit. She seemed to enjoy all the attention around her as the other Housemates took them on a tour of the House. Who woudn’t, especially at a time there seemed to be plenty of beefing around you? So if we consider this Tacha’s high moment in the House, it is apt. Frodd Imagine chasing after a babe for a long time with no positive response? Only to wake up the next day and then the lady gave you a warm kiss? Oh, you can imagine how on top of the world you would feel. Yes, it happened to Frodd, though his was slightly different from the scenario. We imagine how very satisfied the man would be the day Esther kissed on him during the Oppo Runaway Task. Even Twitter couldn’t let it slip through. Esther just kissed frodd!!!!!! Local man’s life is made! #BBNaija pic.twitter.com/2OPZcv4maR — Mercy Lambo (@sewalicious8) July 22, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Frodd after the kiss and lap dance from Esther..Local man is pleased #BBNaija2019 pic.twitter.com/TuWYhA2aFz — ♥goddessfreke ♥. (@indyblair) July 23, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js At least if Frodd doesn’t win 60m, he has gotten a kiss and lap dance from Esther. God used Omashola to work in mysterious ways. Frodd might shed tears of joy tonight o #bbnaija #BBNaija2019 pic.twitter.com/kJRcbyQcMV — Mc Agabzy (@agabzee) July 23, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Ike Imagine your joy when you and your boo jointly win a competition. Yes, it can be a wonderful experience for the both of you. Ike’s moment came when he and mercy won the MunchIt challenge. The excitement on his face that day was like a full blown moon. It’s nice seeing the resident good guy look happy. Mercy Like the other Housemates, Mercy has had her own moment of high spirit. She has also got the time she jumped up for joy. It was when they won the MunchIt challenge. Being the first time both of them would win a Task together, it was a great experience for her. Cindy Remember when Cindy entered Biggie’s House, the surprise on her face. Yes, that’s her own moment. It’s the feeling of super excitement when you see your dream come true. She would later share the experience with her fellow Housemates. Elozonam Being his first win in the Pepper Dem House, Elozonam couldn’t hide his happiness when he alongside Tacha won the MunchIt consolation prize. It’s the joy that comes when you thought you had lost the prize in a competition and was later given something for your effort. It was indeed his own moment in the House. Diane Diane’s high moment in Biggie’s House was when she won the Veto Power. In a House where you don’t know what will happen when you’re up for Eviction, it was worth celebrating. Knowing that she would be safe from Eviction for that week came with much joy. As human beings, we all have our low and high spirit moments. But the one that gives us the course to remember for long is when we did things that made us proud. In the Big brother House, the Pepper Dem Gang had their interesting times and we cannot but capture it well. The Pepper Dem Gang recreated a commercial for Travel Beta and still had time for a dice game. Team Lagos and Team New York won One Million Naira each in the Travel Beta Challenge. The Task which was divided into two focused on creating a commercial about travelling to the best holiday destinations and a game of dice. The Housemates were divided into 3 different teams – Team New York, Team Dubai and Team Lagos. Meet The Teams For a while now, Housemates have carried out their tasks in teams. It was no different this time. Housemates randomly picked cards that revealed the team each belonged to. Khafi, Mercy and Frodd made up Team Lagos. Elozonam, Diane, Ike and Mike belonged to Team New York and Team Dubai was made up of Seyi, Tacha, Cindy and Omashola. Together they all took on the Task Travel Beta had in store for them. Roll The Dice The first Task required that each team roll the dice and every time the die turned a ‘six’, the team had to spell a letter from the word, ‘TravelBeta’. On and on they rolled until Team Lagos (Mercy, Frodd and Khafi) made an amazing comeback to beat Team New York and Team Dubai, securing the One Million Naira cash prize. Ike rolled the most ‘six’ in this Task and we didn’t have to ponder for long on how he got so good. “I paid my bills with this,” he said. Too bad it wasn’t enough to secure a win for Team New York. Fortunately for them, luck smiled on them in the next Task. The Flight Commercial Making a commercial might look easy, but it took a lot of work before Team New York sealed this win. The Task required that each team create a two-minute fun commercial for Travel Beta from the original commercial that was played on the TV in the lounge. Ranked the highest in overall creativity, messaging and professionalism, Team New York walked away with One Million Naira cash prize. Another Saturday, another win. We can’t wait to see how the Pepper Dem Gang perform in the coming Tasks.
