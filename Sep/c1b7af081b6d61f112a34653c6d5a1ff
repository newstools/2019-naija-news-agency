The 12th of August was the date, the Vibes day party was the event, Burg was the venue and the verdict from every guest is that it was a shutdown!. The unique vogue, high-priced event was nothing other than successful, even with no Artiste performance, the vibes machine “DJ Consequence” outdid himself once again as he hosted party-goers to a night of undiluted musicality. It was an array of various genres of music, from Oldies to house, to reggae Bashment, to Urban hip hop, to Afrobeats and finally, Evergreen. The Hennessy sponsored party was without age barrier, as long as you are a lover of music, the vibes day party got you covered. The party celebrated the DJs and the hype-men as they are the reason the party never stops. It’s no joke when they say “The party doesn’t start till the vibes machine comes on deck” as the crowd was thrown into an insane frenzy the minute DJ Consequence took over the wheels and drove them with no breaks to the brink. Vibes Day Party “The Genesis” was the beginning of something different and it is here to stay. Keep your ears on the ground as DJ Consequence is ready to hold you down for the rest of the year. On the 1st of October 2019, they bring to you the Vibes Day Party ( The All white Affair ) as the sequel to ‘The Genesis’. Brace yourselves and expect the unexpected.
