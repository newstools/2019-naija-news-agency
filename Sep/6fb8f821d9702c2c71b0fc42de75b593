How important will Man City’s 3-2 defeat to Norwich be in the Premier League title race? In the shock of the season, an injury-plagued Canaries side managed to beat the reigning champs on Saturday. Norwich were well-worth their win against the Sky Blues after goals from Kenny McLean and Todd Cantwell put the hosts 2-up after 28 minutes. Sergio Aguero scored on the stroke of halftime, but Teemu Pukki restored Norwich’s 2-goal cushion after the break. Rodri’s late goal for City proved to be a mere consolation. Earlier in the day, Liverpool beat Newcastle United 3-1 at Anfield. A brilliant goal from Jetro Willems silenced Anfield after 7 minutes. However, Sadio Mane scored a brace in the first-half to hand Liverpool the halftime lead. Mo Salah scored Liverpool’s third in the second period to wrap up the points. So how did Pep Guardiola sum up Saturday for Man City? After losing to Norwich, the Spaniard was drawn into a discussion about the Premier League title race. Sarcastically, Guardiola joked that Liverpool should be crowned champions in September. He said: Five points (behind Liverpool) is five points – but we are in September. What are we supposed to do? Say ‘it’s September and congratulations to Liverpool, you are champions?’ Not for one second am I going to doubt my players.   ‪“Congratulations Liverpool, you are the champions!” 🤔‬ . .A sarcastic Pep Guardiola insists @mancity’s quest for a third consecutive Premier League title is far from over… 🙅‍♂️‬ . . . . . . .#city #liverpool #pep #football #premierleague A post shared by  HaytersTV (@hayterstv) on Sep 14, 2019 at 2:21pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js   “Pep is a genius, a world-class coach” 👏 . .”All fingers are crossed for him and for Jurgen!” 😂🇩🇪 . . @norwichcityfc boss Daniel Farke revels in “special day” as @mancity suffer first league defeat since January 😵 . . . . . . . . . . .#city #football #premierleague #pep #germany A post shared by  HaytersTV (@hayterstv) on Sep 14, 2019 at 1:36pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Also see: Watford vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions.
