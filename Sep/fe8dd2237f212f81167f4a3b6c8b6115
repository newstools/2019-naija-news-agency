On Thursday, the UK government have issued their latest report into football-related arrests and banning orders from last season. The headline findings of the report are as follows. There were 1381 arrests last season at football matches, which is a 10% decrease on the previous season. Todayâ€™s arrest figures are a new low record. In addition, the British Transport Police made 155 football-related arrests. As of 1 August 2019, 1771 banning orders were in force. That represents a decrease of 3% on the previous season. Newcastle United (71) lead the list when it comes to football banning orders. When it comes to which clubs suffered the most arrests, Stoke City lead the way. 80 Stoke City fans were arrested last season. However, itâ€™s worth remembering that 62 of those arrests were linked to a match between Stoke and Port Vale in December 2018. Footage has emerged of a football fan jumping on top of a womanâ€™s car after the Checkatrade trophy game between Port Vale and Stoke City u21s last night.

Third in the table are Aston Villa (42) followed by fellow Premier League newbies Sheffield United (41). Premier League champions Man City (39) round off the top five clubs with the most arrests. As ever with official crime statistics, we need to be cautious about assuming they mirror the actual levels of criminality experienced or occurring. Nevertheless, they make it difficult to maintain the narrative that football disorder is increasing. â€” Geoff Pearson (@Geoff_Pearson) September 19, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js There are more arrests in the 18-34 age group than any other lending weight to my argument that we should see more intervention initiatives by FCs & where appropriate, in conjunction with local police Most FCs have community arms so thereâ€™s no real reason for this not to happen https://t.co/s9rfObfI6F â€” FSA Faircop (@FSA_FairCop) September 19, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Also see:Â Southampton vs Bournemouth betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions.
