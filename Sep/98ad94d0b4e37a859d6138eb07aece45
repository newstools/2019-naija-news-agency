Bad news for Ireland and Sheffield United. Blades duo David McGoldrick and Callum Robinson have both sustained injuries on international duty. McGoldrick and Robinson were both subbed out of the 1-1 draw with Switzerland. McGoldrick, who scored his first international goal for Ireland against the Swiss, picked up a shoulder injury. Robinson left the Euro 2020 qualifier with a thigh problem.   Go on…let’s have another look at that David McGoldrick goal ⚽️ A post shared by  FAIreland (@faireland) on Sep 6, 2019 at 3:35am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js David came into camp with a shoulder injury, but was determined to play against Switzerland and what a game he had. He was brilliant from start to finish and capped off a great performance with a first Ireland goal that was no more than he deserved. Callum felt his hamstring in the second half of the game, so it is best now that he also goes back to Sheffield United for treatment. Ireland are top of the Group D table in Euro 2020 qualifying following a 1-1 draw with the Swiss. However, Denmark and Switzerland both have games in hand over Ireland. Sheffield United fans will now fear that McGoldrick and Robinson will miss next weekend’s Premier League match against Southampton. Manager Chris Wilder’s other injury concern relates to John Fleck (thigh). As for Southampton, they have their own set of selection problems. Kevin Danso is out of the Sheffield United match through suspension. Nathan Redmond is sidelined with an ankle injury. Moussa Djenepo is on the treatment table with a muscular problem. While the Saints also have injury doubts over Michael Obafemi and Ryan Bertrand. Also see: Cristiano Ronaldo makes time for Nemanja Matic’s son after Serbia 2 – Portugal 4.
