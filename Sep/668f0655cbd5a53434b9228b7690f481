Matteo Guendouzi joined Arsenal in the summer of 2018 from French side, FC Lorient. The Gunners are believed to have paid in the region of £7.2m for the midfielder’s services. The season before he signed for Arsenal Guendouzi was only playing Ligue 2 football with Lorient. However, despite his minimal experience, Guendouzi had a decent debut season in the Premier League. The 20-year-old played 48 games across all competitions last campaign for Arsenal, scoring one and assisting two. Guendouzi has also had a solid start to the current season, playing in all four of Arsenal’s league games so far.
