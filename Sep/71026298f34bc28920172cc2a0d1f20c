 The singer earlier today took to his Twitter page to attack the music celebrities that got into the realm of exchange of words over the currently trending unfortunate happenings in South Africa. Wizkid who seemed really upset about the whole Twitter melee slammed a lot of the involved artistes and encouraged everyone to embrace love. But a lot of people felt he used words he shouldn’t have thought of considering it could kill his intention for the tweet. After realizing he must have over-reacted and used words that are uncalled for, the superstar got really humbled as he tendered an apology. He wrote; “Me sef just dey use F word up and down. Apologies for my swear words people, we’re all humans. Bottom line be say make we no let this separate us. One love”  The post Wizkid Tenders Apology Over Earlier Fierce Outburst, Says He Only Wants A United People appeared first on tooXclusive. Source: Too Xclusive
