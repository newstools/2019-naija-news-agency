 Afrobeat singer, Seun Kuti who is the son of music legend Fela Anikulapo Kuti is the cover star for Guardian life Magazine’s Latest Issue. Seun has created a niche for himself in the music world via his style of music and also the constant activism portrayed in his music. The Awakening The conviction I have today are borne from the foundation of my home but it is not because of the foundation of my home. I came to the awakening and consciousness independent of my father’s influence. Everybody’s awakening is an independent journey. The Path Of Activism The new way of oppressing people that speak the truth today is exclusion… My message contradicts the message of the elites…Even now, Fela is not played often in the media. If Fela was around now, it would be difficult for his music to rise like it did because there is so much distraction. The oppressors always look to perfect oppression. They practice a system of exclusion. Back in the days, they used to be crude but they have realised that it only makes you popular. So they own everything and exclude you from it. It is not enough to say you love Africa, you need to know about Africa.  Watch the B.T.S of his cover shoot below:  Despite starting his music career at the age of eight alongside his legendary father, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, the Grammy nominated Seun Kuti (@bigbirdkuti) has been able to carve a niche for himself in the music industry. While he acknowledges that he was influenced by his parents, he insists that unlike what was common in those days, his parents gave him the option to choose whatever profession he deemed fit.
