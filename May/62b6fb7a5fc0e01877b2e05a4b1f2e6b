Famous Nigerian Actress, Iyabo Ojo, shared an emotional story of how she raised her two children as a single mother. She shared this in an Instagram video on Mothers’ Day detailing her gut-wrenching experiences in her previous marriage. According to the actress, she got the shock of her life from her ex-husband on their wedding night when he said to her, “I only married you because you are pregnant, I don’t love you”. This shocking revelation led to her focus on showering all her love upon her son, whom she was pregnant with at the time. According to her “The moment he popped out of me, all the pain, blame, guilt went away.” Iyabo Ojo narrated the way she tried to save her marriage and in the process became pregnant with her daughter, who is her second child with her ex-husband. Situations became worse, as her husband was no longer present at home, and when she became due, she could not afford to go to a hospital because she had onlyÂ â‚¦150 on her.  She had to appeal to a nurse who lived nearby to assist her with birthing the child. After giving birth to her daughter, Priscilla, she lost consciousness as a result of massive loss of blood. She went on to recount how she picked up the courage and strength to walk out of the marriage in order to maintain her sanity and focus on taking care of her children. The actress shed tears of joy expressing how she has been able to take care of her children and even other people’s children. She stated that she chose to share her story to encourage people, particularly mothers that they are capable of doing amazing things, and whenever they find themselves doubting how far they can go, they should remember how far they have come. Everyone has a story, everyone’s life is a story. I decided to share a bit with you, to strengthen and to encourage someone out there. Weâ€™re all capable of doing amazing things…. but whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you have come. ……………….. never stop in your storm Isaiah 41:10 So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
