 Thank God Omori Jesam, a 24-year-old videographer, who is behind the music video for the controversial ‘Am I A Yahoo Boy’ song by street-hop star Naira Marley hasÂ broken his silence on why he accepted to helm the video shoot despite the outcry over the song. Following the reported arrest of Marley by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Jesam, popularly known as TG Omori has spoken of how he was approached for the job. He said: “I woke up to a DM from Naira Marley four days before the video shoot asking “AM I A YAHOO BOY? Lol”. I replied with a laughing emoji and he asked for my WhatsApp contact. Then he sent the song asking for a video direction. “Considering the controversy behind the song and all, It wasnâ€™t really so crazy to crack out an idea for it because basically, all the song was talking about is him trying to clear the air that he is not a fraudster.” TG Omori, who hails from Cross-River State, says the video was shot in three days and he had to improvise to get it done. He said: “I thought of getting a police truck but considering the short notice I had to film this which was between three days, I was only left with an option of hiring a bullion van and brand it to look like a police armoured tank. I had to build a car wash set and tagged it ‘No Mannaz’ and we shot it on a Sunday. “We shot the video in six hours featuring from Zlatan Ibile and special appearances from his friends and fans. The whole idea behind the video was to give a visual representation that my client is just trying to clear the air that he is not a fraudster.” TG Omori, who was inspired by the works of legendary filmmaker Tunde Kelani, had his start as a director at 15 while overseeing stage plays in his school and church. He graduated from Pencil Film Institute at 18, making him the youngest professional filmmaker in Nigeria at the time. Commenting on Pretty Mike’s allegation that some of his colleagues offer video vixens roles for sex, he said “video directors are humans like everybody else and their individual sexual conduct depends on them. “Because one director is asking you for sex for roles doesn’t mean all other directors do that. If I was the one on that table, I will probably sue Pretty Mike but thank God I have a different drive about what I want to be known for”. TG Omori’s first professional music video was ‘Respect A Woman’ by ES PLUS in 2015. He has since built an outstanding portfolio, working with top African artists such as Kenya’s Khaligraph Jones (Gwala), and on RudeBoyâ€™s ‘Ifai’ video, Reminisceâ€™s ‘Oja’, YCEEâ€™s ‘My Side’, Dj Ecoolâ€™s ‘Kilode’, among others. The video director noted that he was overwhelmed while working with Rudeboy and Reminisce. He said: “It was an honour having to work with these legends. I was overwhelmed by the level of confidence they had in me and how they let me express myself without questioning. It was a wonderful feeling.” Speaking on his unique sense of style and his flashy dressing, TG Omori said: “I am trying to make a statement that you can be a creative director and still stay fly.” In December 2018, TG Omori was described by some as the future of music video directing in Nigeria and was praised for making a significant impact in a short time.
