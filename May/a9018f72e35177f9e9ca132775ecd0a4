 Top UN officials, including Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, have condemned Sundayâ€™s deadly attack on a Catholic church in Burkina Faso. At least six people, including the priest, were killed when gunmen opened fire on the worshippers at the church in the north of the country, media reports say. The incident reportedly took place in the village of Dablo, located in a region that has seen an upsurge in violence in recent months.Â â€œThe churchÂ wasÂ burned to the ground, along with other buildings including a healthÂ centre,â€� the UN said on its website. In a statement, Guterres urged â€œall citizens of Burkina Faso to stand firmly with one another across communitiesâ€�. The UN chief advised them against buying into attempts by the perpetrators and their sponsors to sow discord and breed further violence. He also recalled the sanctity of all places of worship, and expressed his hopes the perpetrators can be swiftly brought to justice. President of the UN General Assembly, Ms Maria Espinosa, also expressed outrage in a tweet on Sunday evening. Espinosa said the killers must be held accountable, adding that â€œwe cannot tolerate hatred. The fundamental right of religious freedom must be respected everywhereâ€�. Also reacting, the UN Resident Coordinator in Burkina Faso,Â Mrs MetsiÂ Makhetha, tweeted her condemnation of the â€œheinous attacksâ€�. She offered her condolences to the families of those who lost their lives.Â The UN said the attacks occurred just days after its humanitarian officials, including Makhetha, warned of an â€œunprecedentedâ€� rise in â€œsophisticated armed attacks in the Sahelâ€�. In a report to member states on Wednesday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said the development was putting the future of a â€œwhole generationâ€� at stake.Â â€œViolence is spreading in Mali and Niger, as well as Burkina Faso, and risks spilling over into other West African countries. â€œThis has ledÂ to a five-fold rise in the displacement of the local population in the last 12 months, who have seen more than 330,000 people leave their homes, in addition to 100,000 refugees,â€�OCHA said. According to Makhetha, â€œISIS-inspiredâ€� armed groups, threaten to destabilise longstanding traditional methods of community-based conflict resolution.Â â€œThe UN, partner humanitarian organisations and governments have stepped up operations. But we must do more,â€� she said. The post UN Condemns Attack On Burkina Faso Church UN Condemns Attack On Burkina Faso Church
