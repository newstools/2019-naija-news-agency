RainyMilli â€“ Check Your Balance RainyMilli releases his second single “Check Your Balance”. This comes as a follow up to his viral debut single “Eko to London”. Check Your Balance has a very catchy chorus and flow that everyone can relate to because it asks a simple yet truthful question, “Check Your Balance, Can you Buy the Balance?”, Balance refering to the luxury designer brand Balenciaga. From the beat, to the chorus, to the energetic adlibs and fun verses, #CheckYourBalance is the new slang and song on the street. Before you do anything above your means, always Check Your Balance.
