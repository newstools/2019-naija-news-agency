 ABUJA –Â Mr. Victor Ikechukwu Oye, the national chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), has been urged to account for the N640million realised from the sales of the nomination forms to the partyâ€™s members in Imo State during the 2019 elections. At a media briefing on Tuesday in Abuja, the former national youth leader, Comrade Ikechukwu Chukwunyere, accused the national chairman of violating of the partyâ€™s constitution. Chukwunyere noted that despite the exorbitant amount charged on the sale of nomination and delegate forms and other unknown fees to the partyâ€™s constitution, there were no delegate/primary elections which created distrust, disloyalty, and defection of party members to other political parties. He threatened to invite the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other anti-corruption security agencies to ensure that Oye gave account of how the money was expended. He further lamented that the national convention of APGA has been slated for May 27, 2019, and there was no publication to this effect in either the print or electronic media, adding that intending aspirants have been kept in the dark. He decried a situation where the party has not had its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting for a long time now, adding that the development had denied the party members the opportunity to review, make policies and set goals for the party. According to him, â€œIt is boggling to note that the national chairman has refused to release the time-table and even make the date for the convention known to the members of the party. â€œIt has been uncovered that his refusal to make the convention date public is a ploy to perpetuate himself in the leadership of the party. â€œIt is heartbreaking that a man who has turned the party upside down since assumption of office wants to contest for a second term, even though majority of the party members frown at this aberration. â€œI want to state emphatically that Mr. Victor Oye failed the party in the recent elections. I remember in 2015, after his election, he had promised to install 10 APGA governors in the states of the federation but our outing in the 2019 elections was really shameful and disgraceful. â€œImo State which we would have been easily won was marred with fraudulent congresses, thereby producing unpopular candidates. This showed the bad leadership style of Mr. Victor Oye. â€œOye will not be allowed to run APGA like a garrison where he dishes out orders to members and any member who disagrees with him is either suspended or expelled from the party.â€� He, therefore, called for the resignation of the national chairman, urging the Governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, to reject Oye, just like other leaders of the party have done.
