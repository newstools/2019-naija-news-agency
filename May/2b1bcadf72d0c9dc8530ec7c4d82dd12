Astrid, also known as Ada, is a Nigerian-German, a wife and a mother of two lovely boys. Like you and I, she lived a normal life till cancer crept in, hitting her hard. Currently battling with a severe form of blood cancer- Acute Myeloid Leukemia, she is in urgent need of a stem cell/ bone marrow donor.  What is peculiar about Astridâ€™s case is the fact that it is extremely difficult for people of mixed ethnic origin like her to find a suitable stem cell/ bone marrow donor. In the world, less than 3% of people registered as donors have a mixed ethnic background. We are using this opportunity to make an open call to individuals of African-European or African-Caucasian descent to help Ada stay alive to take care of her two lovely boys by being a stem cell/ bone marrow donor. Give her hope for life and a chance to see her boys grow to become men. If any of your parents comes from West Africa, ideally Nigeria; from the ethnic group of Ibo/ Igbo and the other from Europe, you can save Astridâ€™s life by volunteering to be a donator.
