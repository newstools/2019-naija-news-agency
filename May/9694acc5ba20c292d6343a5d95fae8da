 Maj.-Gen. Anthony Ebozoje, the Deputy Director, Policy and Plans (Army) says troops need continuous training to be able to surmount Nigeriaâ€™s current security challenges. Ebozoje made the remark as Special Guest at the conclusion of a week-long sports competition, organised by the Headquarters of the Nigerian Army Garrison, Abuja, for the rank of corporals and below. He described training as one of the pillars of professionalism that increased troopsâ€™ proficiency, physical fitness and made them combat ready. Ebozoje said with proficiency and competency, soldiers would be able to serve the country, protect its territorial integrity and offer citizens the environment to â€œthrive and prosper.â€™â€™ News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that soldiers drawn from various formations and units participated in shooting, 3.2km endurance walk, map reading and obstacle crossing, among others during the competition. NAN also reports that the army headquarters Garrison, representing Group C, with soldiers from the â€œFemale Special Base Battleâ€™â€™ emerged overall winners of the competition.
