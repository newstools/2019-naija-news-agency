 Mr Idris Nyam, the newly appointed Accountant General in Kaduna State, in this interview with JULIET OYOYO speaks on some of the economic prospects of Kaduna and how the second term of the governor would add value to the lives of the citizens in the state. Excerpts: Sir, you have just been appointed as the new Accountant General of Kaduna state. Many would like to know what made the Governor to appoint you as one of his aides? First of all, I want to thank Almighty God for giving me this opportunity to serve my state and indeed, my governor. My governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, as everybody knows, is the governors-governor and a performer. For me, it is a great opportunity to be able to serve him. I was first of all appointed as Senior Special Assistant on Governmental Matters late in 2016 and barely few months in that capacity, I was appointed as the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and was in that capacity until last week when His Excellency, Governor el-Rufai deemed it fit and found me trustworthy enough to be able to hold such a sensitive position. I feel deeply honoured and I will be forever grateful for giving me this opportunity to serve and I will give my all in all, more than I have ever done before, and make sure I do what is expected of me and to make things proper for this government. The state has been commended for itsÂ  wonderfulÂ  strides in boosting Â  its Internally Generated Revenue, IGR. CouldÂ  you tell us the areas you believe needs to be improved upon as the Accountant General of the state. Generally, the office of Accountant General is mostly about treasury activities, book-keeping and the likes, but what I plan to do is to ensure that our activities are even more transparent than ever before. Good governance and transparency has been one of the focal points of this administration led by Mallam Nasir Ahmed el-Rufai. By the time we are done, the difference will be obvious. Among the states in the country, we are the first to come out with our budget and our accounting statements. With our opening drive, we even went further by making our books accessible to the international communities. Everything that has to do with the government is out there in the public domain especially in its website; â€œstateng.org.ngâ€� and we have also subjected ourselves to international rating and we have maintained a very laudable position in the last six (6) years running. For me, it is very important that we are seen more as an open and transparent government and our books are clean and represent the true state of the Kaduna state government and that is what we are set to do. What should the citizens Â  expect from the governmentÂ  in second term in terms of infrastructural development? When this administration came into office mid 2015, a lot of time and efforts were put into place to develop a state developmental plan. After you have a plan; you must plan otherwise you plan to fail, there is also the â€œState Implementation Plan, SIP and the government has been working along those lines on what it intends to do, years ahead. These have been consistently applied as regards what it exactly wants to do. We started along those lines and we also assessed ourselves to see how far we have gone with the plans and where necessary, made minor adjustments. I donâ€™t see why one should work outside his plans and that is majorly, what has happened. We have tried to do, that whatever we have set out to do, is within our work plan and we set out to achieve it. That is what we have been doing. This state is blessed with a lot of natural resources. How does the government hope to tap into this to boost the IGR of the state especially in Birnin Gwari Local Government which is reputed to have huge deposits of gold? We have had various fora and we just concluded one, KADINVEST 4.0; we have had four tiers of such which showcased the potentials of the state. So, right from KADINVEST 1.0, 2.0, it had already been established that we had so much natural mineral resources in Birnin Gwari. Everything is being done to make sure that everything can be brought to access and develop it and also ensure that investors get the maximum advantage while coming to invest. It is not just about coming to invest but also, growing the economy of the state. I am sure that, by the time we have full investments, we would have taken care of issues that have to do with security, improving on the poverty level and many other areas we have mapped out. We are looking towards all of that. The governor is highly regarded as a working governor and does not leave any stone unturned when he sets out to do something that is of immense benefit to the good people of the state. Tell usÂ  programmesÂ  the governor has in place to woo more investors into the state? Just like I have said, we have the KADINVEST which I just spoke on; you need to take the opportunity that is available. We have the Kaduna Investment Promotion Agency, KADIPA which has been set up which is like a one stop shop to make things happen for every prospective investor where you can do all your business registration and make all the necessary inquiries. This is why Kaduna state has been variously described as the â€œMost Improved Stateâ€� in Nigeria as far as the ease of doing business is concerned. Investors have been coming and we know the impact we have made on the residents and good people of Kaduna state. Kaduna state is a very central state and it is a gate way to the region when you are coming from the South eastern parts of the country. There is a need to make sure that we develop the state so that, when investors come, they reap the benefits. The government is doing a lot of things to make sure the environment is good for the people who are coming in to invest.
