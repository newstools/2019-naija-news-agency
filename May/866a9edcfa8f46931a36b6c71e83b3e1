As Leah Sharibu turns 16 today, Wole Soyinka has taken the time to speak highly of herÂ during an event at Georgetown University, Washington, in the U.S. The Nobel Laureate while talking about the teenager who was abducted from the Government Science College at Dapchi, Yobe State on February 19, 2018, talked about her courage. Professor Wole Soyinka also compared her to Nelson Mandela for refusing to accept a conditional release. In praising her, he recited a part of an ode titled ‘Mandela comes to Leah’, saying: “No”, she said, “Faith is not of compulsion. Her torch undimmed in the den of zealots.” However, Wole Soyinka could only recite excerpts of his ode to Leah as he had broken down the last time he attempted to read it. We hope that Leah is brought home soon and in good health.
