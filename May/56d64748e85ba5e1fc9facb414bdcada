 YENAGOA –Â Mr Seriake Dickson, the Bayelsa State governor, has bemoaned attacks on the judiciary by some political actors, saying that they are a threat to the nationâ€™s foundation and the development of democratic governance in the country. According to him, such onslaughts on judiciary were aimed at weakening and destroying its independence, which should be condemned. Dickson was speaking during the swearing-in of two new state High Court judges in Yenagoa on Tuesday. Those sworn-in were Justice Iniekinimi Uzakah, a former registrar of the High Court, and Justice Abasi Youngman, a former acting director of Civil Litigation Department in the state Ministry of Justice. The chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governorsâ€™ Forum called on Nigerians to give the necessary support and encouragement to the judiciary as an independent arm of government. Dickson said that the importance of judiciary to the growth of democracy could not be over-emphasized, as the judges were the final arbiter in disputes between individuals and organisations under the Nigerian constitution. He applauded the nationâ€™s courts, especially the Supreme Court, for displaying courage despite being faced with difficult circumstances and harsh environment to administer justice in accordance with expectations. Dickson, who described the newly sworn-in High Court judges as gentlemen, reminded them of the sensitive nature and calling of the office, and urged them to use the law as a shield for the people and administer it to all irrespective of status. â€œRemember to use the law as a shield of our people and not to use the law to add to the terrible condition and circumstances under which our people live. â€œThe law should be a servant of our people, the law should be a defendant of our people, it should be invoked for the right causes and justice should be administered to all irrespective of status,â€� the governor said.
