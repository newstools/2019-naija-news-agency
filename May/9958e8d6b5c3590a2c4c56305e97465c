Don’t steal my joke is not a joke among Nigerian comedians who are having a hard time in dealing with their colleagues who plagiarize their work without credit. The issue of telling other people’s joke took a major part of discussions in this year’s edition of the Eko Comedy Festival captioned ‘The Future of Nigeria Comedy’. Many comedians who attended the eventÂ expressed concerns and disapproval on the the level of plagiarism that’s going on in the Nigerian comedy industry and shared ideas on how minimize or get rid of the practice. Part of the solutions was for comedians to copyright their major jokes in order to hold each other accountable. The audience also agreed that if the industry must grow further and be held in high regards, then comedians need to create their own jokes or at least give some credits to the original owners of the joke they use.
