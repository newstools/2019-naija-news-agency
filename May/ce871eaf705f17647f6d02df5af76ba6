Court of Appeal sets aside Osun tribunal judgment which returned Sen. Ademola Adeleke, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDPâ€™s) candidate, as duly elected Governor. Four out of the five-member panel, declared Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as the winner of the September 2018 election. Oyetola approached the court to set aside the majority judgment of the Osun State Election Petition Tribunal which nullified his election and declared Adeleke as the winner of the September 2018 governorship election in Osun State. NAN reports that the tribunal had in its Judgment of March 22, voided Oyetolaâ€™s election and ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to withdraw his Certificate of Return while at the same time ordered INEC to issue a fresh Certificate of Return to Adeleke. However, Oyetola, who contested the last governorship election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has faulted the majority judgement delivered by Justices Peter Obiora and Anyinla Gbolagunte.

He, therefore, asked the appellate court to uphold his appeal, set aside the majority judgment and dismiss the October 16, 2018 petition by PDP and Adeleke. The governor said his complaint, in the appeal, was against the entire majority judgment, except where the tribunal held that it lacked jurisdiction to set aside INEC Guidelines; that the allegation of over voting was not proved; that the petitioners did not prove voided votes and other parts of the judgment where the tribunal agreed with their arguments. Oyetola is contending, in his first ground of appeal, that the entire majority judgment is a nullity because it was written and delivered by Justice Obiora â€œwho did not participate in all the proceedings of the tribunal and who was not present when all the witnesses gave evidence.â€� He noted that Justice Obiora was absent on February 6 this year when the respondents’ witnesses (RWs) 12 and 13 â€“ Ayoola Soji and Oladejo Kazeem â€“ testified and tendered exhibits, which the tribunal admitted in evidence. The appellant argued that, having not attended the tribunalâ€™s sitting on Feb. 6, Justice Obiora could not have seen the two witnesses and was unable to examine their demeanour, as required, and therefore, unlawful for the judge to have authored a judgment in which he reviewed the evidence given by the witnesses. He said: â€œThe writing of and or the participation of the honourable justice P. C. Obiora in the writing of the judgment of the lower tribunal of 22nd March 2019 and delivery of same, vitiates the entire judgment.â€� Oyetola also argued that the tribunal, in its majority judgment, erred in law and acted without jurisdiction when it accepted the petitionersâ€™ complained of non compliance with the provisions of Electoral Act in relation to the Sept. 22, 2018 governorship election in Osun State and on that basis proceeded to nullify the victory of Oyetola and APC. It was equally the appellantâ€™s contention that the tribunal acted without jurisdiction by basing its decision to uphold the petition and set aside the return of the appellants on the basis of an allegation of non-compliance with the Electoral Act, in relation to the Sept. 22 governorship election.
