The Rivers State Government has lifted the ban on employment and promotions in the state civil service which has been on hold for up to 10 years now. The State Governor, Nyesom Wike announced the government decision on Wednesday during the 2019 International Workers Day Celebration at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium, Elekahia, Port Harcourt. The Governor who was represented by his Deputy Dr. Ipalibo Harry Banigo said the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission had already been directed to conduct interviews and effect recruitment of Rivers indigenes to fill existing vacancies as part of efforts to strengthen the civil service for effective service delivery to the Rivers people as well as promote civil servants to their next salary grades. Wike said the government under his watch was committed to tackling social issues by creating the enabling environment for the private sector to create jobs and empower youths. â€œWe are also strengthening our educational system to ensure that our graduates are imbued with appropriate skills and the mindset to become job creators rather than become job seekers and will also continue to implement effective policies and programmes that will address and lift our people from poverty to economic prosperity,â€� Governor Wike further stressed. He disclosed that the government has started implementing the N100-million interest free-loan to civil servants in a bid to advance the welfare and wellbeing of the state civil servants.

Itubo congratulated Governor Wike and his deputy for their victory at the election saying the election was a referendum on the performance of Wike’s in the last 4 years and noting that the victory was an indication that a large number of the voting public in the state are happy with the governor.
