 Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane is unhappy with Luka Modricâ€™s form and is considering selling the Croatian midfielder this summer. The 33-year-old has suffered a dramatic loss in form this term after his performances in the last campaign earned him the Ballon dâ€™Or award. Modric is far from the only Madrid player to be suffering this season but Zidane had no concerns over the former Spurs star when he returned to the club in March. Zidane had made up his mind on the majority of the squad by the time he had returned, given he knew them from his first stint at the Bernabeu.

Madrid rejected offers from Inter Milan last summer for the Croat but the club are now said to be willing to let him go. Modric, who joined the club in 2012, is said to be happy in Madrid but will not stay where heâ€™s not wanted. Zidane only returned to the club on the promise that he will be given significant funds to rebuild at the Bernabeu.
