 Abuja –Â Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State has been warned, along with his agents, to stay away from Nsu Ceramics and Tiles Industry sited in Nsu, Ehime Mbano by late Governor Sam OnunakaÂ  Mbakwe or face the full wrath of the community. The community consisting of four autonomous communities also at the weekend issued similar words of caution to members of the security agencies not to allow themselves to be used by the outgoing administration or by its agents to perpetuate and sustain ongoing looting of assets of Imo people. The governor had about 18 months ago trucked away container loads of equipment imported by the administration of the late former Governor, purportedly to a”safe location”, findings proved though that the move was only the beginning of the calculated looting of the factory. This time, perhaps sensing massive resistance, the governor, we gathered surreptitiously sold the rest of Ceramic equipmentÂ  at a secret auction to one Messrs Phigeal Integrated Int’l LimitedÂ  authorizing them as auctioneers subject to payment of N16,866,000(Sixteen million, eight hundred and sixty six thousand only), sparking widespread outrage amongÂ  NSU indigenes and home and diaspora. Rising from a mandatory meeting summoned at the behest of traditional rulers of the autonomous communities, Town Union president and leaders of thought, the community vowed to resist any attempt by the governor or his proxies to complete the alleged looting of the factory. They also put on notice the incoming Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration in the state led by Hon.Â  Emeka Ihedioha on the urgent need to recover all property of the state held by governor Okorocha and his agents. The community also seized the occasion to draw the attention of the incoming government of a litany of the abandoned project in the area and the glaring absence of both state and federal government presence in the community that was leading light in pre-independence Nigeria. A strongly worded communiquÃ© issued at the end of the meeting read in part: “The attention of the entire NSU clan comprising four autonomous communities has been drawn to a letter purported to be issued to Messrs Phigeal Integrated Int’l Limited by Imo State Government authorizing them as auctioneers subject to payment of N16,866,000(Sixteen million, eight hundred and sixty six thousand naira only) to enter intoÂ  an auction the remaining equipments at the premises of Imo tiles industry at NSU. Recalling that prior to this development, Governor Rochas Okorocha and his private agents had about a year ago forcefully evacuated to unknown destination, containers of equipments includingÂ  Rolls Royce high Calibre power generators valued at billions of naira imported for the factory by the glorious Mbakwe administration, the entire NSU clan considers this development insensitive, a provocative affront and an attempt by the outgoing Governor of Imo â€¦ The post NSU Tiles: Community Tackle Gov Okorocha, Halts Sale Of Imo Assets NSU Tiles: Community Tackle Gov Okorocha, Halts Sale Of Imo Assets
