 Gov. David Umahi of Ebonyi has promised to cheer the Ohaozara West State Constituency to victory in the Divine Mandate football Super Cup competition final against Abakaliki North Constituency on Sunday. Â The Divine Mandate (the governorâ€™s campaign slogan) Super Cup is competed by the 24 state constituencies in Ebony as Ohaozara West is the governorâ€™s home constituency. Mr Charles Akpueneika, the Commissioner for Youth Development and Sports disclosed on Friday in Abakaliki that the third-place match between Ohaozara East and Ebonyi North-East constituencies would also take place on Sunday. Akpuenika noted that the governor directed that both matches be played at the Osborne Event Centre football pitch, Uburu, Ohaoazara LGA (his hometown) instead of the competitionâ€™s venue, the Pa Ngele Oruta Stadium Abakaliki. â€œThe governor is interested in watching both matches as the concerned teams must arrive Uburu with their supporters before 1 p.m.,â€� Akpueneika said in a statement. Desmond Ome, the Ebonyi Football Association (FA) Secretary and the Head of Organisation of the competition, told NAN that all knotty issues at the competition had been effectively tackled. â€œWe have to apply the rules governing football to tackle issues such as the assault on a referee and the walk-over of the Ebonyi North-East team in its semifinal match with Ohaozara West. â€œOn the issue of the assault on a referee, we investigated the matter, identified the fan who carried out the assault, duly fined the team he is supporting and mandated it to compensate the referee. â€œThe second semifinal clash between Ohaozara West and Ebonyi North- East was stalemated after regulation time and the match officials decided to discontinue with it due to poor visibility. â€œWe decided to go into straight penalty shootout the next morning but the leader of the Ebonyi North-East team said that it had liaised with his opponent and they agreed to replay the match fully, the next day. â€œI confirm the claim from its opponent and they agreed to offset all expenses that would be incurred in replaying the match,â€� he said. The FA secretary noted that he convened a pre-match meeting the following day and fixed the match for 3 p.m. as both teams complied with all pre-match formalities and agreed to play the match at that time. â€œWhen the officials were, however, ready for the match, the Ebonyi North-East team did not appear for the match in spite of assurances from its leader. â€œThe match officials waited for 45 minutes for the team to appear but it didnâ€™t and they had no option than to declare a walk-over in favour of Ohaozara West team. â€œThis decision was taken in conformity with the rules governing the competition and not to disqualify or favour any team or highly-placed individual as being insinuated in some quarters,â€� he said. Sule Mohammed, Leader of the Ebonyi North-East team, assured that the team would honour the third-place match on Sunday and absolved the organising committee of any complicity. â€œMost of the players failed to appear for the match due to the observance of the Ramadan fast and contrary to insinuations, we accept that it was our fault and the organising committee was in order,â€� he said.
