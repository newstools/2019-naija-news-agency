Darryn Zewalk (@darrynzewalk) May 13, 2019 A little #MondayMotivation to all…whether you are finishing the school year, trying to heal from the past, going through a massive life change…just keep putting one foot in front of the other pic.twitter.com/8ESwXaOMs6 â€” Kate Lindquist (@heARTISTatWORK) May 13, 2019 Note to self: Everything you’re fighting for will come to life. Head down, hustle up!! Let’s go#MondayMotivation pic.twitter.com/G0GrfhAGiq â€” Tervin (@YungSkull_ZA) May 13, 2019 You donâ€™t need to
explain yourself
to anyone. You need to
BE yourself
with everyone. What bullies do
is an expression of
their own inner world,
darkened by ignorance. In other words:
itâ€™s a reflection of THEIR lack,
not of YOURS. Trust yourself.#ShineOn#MondayMotivation â€” Gordana Biernat (@MyPowertalk) May 13, 2019 REMEMBER: â€¢ Choose kindness
â€¢ Declutter & simplify
â€¢ Dedicate time to yourself
â€¢ Accept what you can’t change
â€¢ Appreciate where you are in life
â€¢ Work towards your greater goals
â€¢ Choose to have a positive mindset
â€¢ Let go of what no longer serves you#MondayMotivation â€” Vex King (@VexKing) May 13, 2019 You woke up this morning so take advantage of this day #MondayMotivation â€”  (@Tyrie_1) May 13, 2019 #MondayMotivation
Just another Monday? Or a new Monday. Choose your mood. You can choose how you want to feel today. You can choose how you want to feel about the things that happen today. It’s *Your* Choice. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s not. .@JensenAckles Nashville, 2019 pic.twitter.com/5z8d6aio5Y â€” Kim  (@MamaPrior) May 13, 2019 Nothing great was ever achieved without effort and sacrifice.#quote #MondayMotivation pic.twitter.com/ml7IAOjDpp â€” Ranal Currie (@Ranal55) May 13, 2019 “If your ship doesn’t come in, swim out to it.”#MondayMorning #MondayMotivation pic.twitter.com/A7kMHslfpD â€” Doc Flower (@realmedicineMI) May 13, 2019 Your quitting point is often your breakthrough point, don’t give up just yet! #MondayMotivation#IHaveDOminion pic.twitter.com/Fx4EZo9Td4 â€” David Oyedepo Min.
