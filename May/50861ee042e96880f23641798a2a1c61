 Heineken, the worldâ€™s leading international premium beer brand has announced 7 winners of its all-expense paid travel experience to Liverpool. The 7 lucky consumers who were selected in a draw that took place at different Heineken viewing experience centers will get to enjoy activities like a tour of the Old Trafford Stadium, and dinner at Rio Ferdinandâ€™s Rosso restaurant. These winners will not only enjoy premium in flight experience, hotel accommodation, and Trafford centre shopping experience, they will also get to watch their favorite stars play in the thrilling second leg encounter between Premier League title hopefuls, Liverpool FC, and La Liga Champions, FC Barcelona! Champions League fans live for the fairytale that football can be and the stories they can make of those nerve racking moments. These two semi-finalists have met 6 times in past UEFA fixtures, with Liverpool only beating Barcelona at the Nou Camp the fifth time, a retaliation for their 3rd meeting in 2001 when Barca beat them at Anfield, despite a Michael Owen lead goal. Marketing Director NB Plc., Mr. Emmanuel Oriakhi, in his statement said -â€œThe UEFA Champions League is the most sought-after event in club football competition, and one of the most followed sporting spectacles in the world. As a brand, we care a lot about our consumers, and giving them the opportunity to watch their favorite teams play live at the stadium is just another way of appreciating and giving them the total footballing experience they deserve.” Expressing his excitement, Adeleke Olugbemi, one of the lucky consumers to be sponsored by Heineken to see the match, said: â€œI look forward to having a fantastic experience I must confess. To watch a major Champions League match live at the stadium is exciting and a completely different experience for me. I canâ€™t thank Heineken enough for this.â€� Already this year, the Heineken sponsored UEFA Champions League tour saw fans meet Barcelona legend, Carles Puyol, and watch as he captained Team Chairman against Team Shine Shine Bobo led by Nigerian football legend, Jay-Jay Okocha. They also got the chance to see the Olâ€™ Big Ears trophy, which has been lifted by Ronaldinho, Giggs, Pirlo and other stars.  While many people already see Barcelona in the final, others believe Liverpool will give it all they have and might come really close to a draw even if they canâ€™t secure a spot in the finals. The biggest winners are these fans who will enjoy all the excitement the game will offer, and Heineken is proud to be giving 7 people that opportunity. As part of this commitment to providing fans and consumers with the most remarkable and unmissable moments from this yearâ€™s Champions League, Heineken has partnered with hundreds of outlets across Nigeria to deliver premium viewing experiences to consumers nationwide. Heineken is recognized for developing interactive and innovative campaigns and breaking new grounds in its approach to marketing. These innovative strategies not only create revolutionary experiences, but also deepen connections with consumers.
