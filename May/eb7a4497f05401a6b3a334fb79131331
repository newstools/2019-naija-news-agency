Rihanna is out here releasing everything but new music! The singer and serial entrepreneur is launching her very own fashion label with luxury house, LVMH (MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton), a move which will make her the first woman in history to create an original brand at the french luxury house..  And there is already a logo too!  Chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH,Â Bernard Arnault, had this to say about the new venture, “Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership atÂ Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader. She naturally finds her full place within LVMH. To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources. I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.â€�  Rih on her part said, â€œDesigning a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldnâ€™t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and Iâ€™m ready for the world to see what we have built together.â€� The label whichÂ would debut for spring 2019 retailing will be â€œcentered onÂ Rihanna, developed by her, and take shape with her vision in terms of ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand.â€� The post It’s Confirmed!
