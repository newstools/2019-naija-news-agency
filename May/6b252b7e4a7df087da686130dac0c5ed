 Abuja –Â Justice Modupe Osho-Adebiyi of High Court of the Federal Capital Territory has ordered that a â€˜religious leaderâ€™, Pastor Dennis Ogbede, be remanded in prison custody over alleged land fraud to the tune of N35 million. The court stated that Ogbede would be in prison until he produces a bail sum of N2m and two sureties in like sum. Justice Modupe Osho-Adebiyi said the sureties must be civil servants, of which one must not be less than Grade Level 14, with landed properties in the FCT. The remand order was sequel to Ogbede’s arraignment on Tuesday. However, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the offences. Ogbede, a director of Alidenco Systems Nigeria Ltd, was arraigned for allegedly defrauding Maje Umar Nafiu of Maje Investment and Construction Company Ltd to the tune of N35m in land acquisition in 2009. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) filed a three-count charges against Ogbede on account of his alleged presentation of fake land titles for Wumba area of the FCT to Nafiu. The EFCC further claimed that Ogbede agreed to refund a sum of N25m through three post-dated Zenith Bank Plc cheques, which all failed to clear upon presentation to the bank in December, 2015. The offences violated Section 1(1) Of Dud Cheque Offences Act and punishable under same section (i) (i) of the same Act. Defence counsel, Isaac Imo had begged the court to grant bail to Ogbede on the grounds that he is a religious leader and also has a pending civil suit in court challenging the refund of the N35m. EFCC counsel, Samuel Ugwuegbulem did not oppose the bail as it was the discretion of the court to grant bail. The case was adjourned to May 30 for hearing.
