<p class="">During the interesting and insightful episode of Loose Talk, he says Tiwa is one of the best he ever worked with. </p> <h1>On the last episode of Loose Talk Podcast titled, â€˜The Blueprintâ€™ featuring Nigerian music legend, Don Jazzy. Incidentally, the interview came on the same day Tiwa Savage exited Mavin Records was announced and a few days after Simiâ€™s exit from X3M music. </h1> <p class="">While the spotlight was shined on the issue, Don Jazzy says heâ€™s still business partners with Tiwa Savage. </p> <p class="">He says, <em>â€œItâ€™s obvious to everybody, it was an epic journey. I donâ€™t necessarily even feel like now because youâ€™ve signed to Universal, to everybody it just looks like sheâ€™s gone to the land beyond beyond. I donâ€™t understand, weâ€™re still business partners, thereâ€™s still catalogues that we share, that sheâ€™s still going to be receiving royalties from for the rest of her life or whatever</em>.</p> <p class="">â€œ<em>The business was dope, and sheâ€™s actually one of my favourite business partners of all time. I mean, myself and Dâ€™Banj worked together for eight years and one year, Tiwa would have been eight years too as well. It was beautiful, she was understanding from the get-go till now. </em></p> <p class=""><em>"Thereâ€™s nothing she doesnâ€™t understand, we try as much as possible to understand each other. Sometimes, even when should disagree with each other on some things, sheâ€™s just matured, you know. </em></p> <p class=""><em>â€œSheâ€™s loving, and knew what she wanted from day one</em>.â€�</p> <p class="">On the topic of the new kid on the block, <strong>Rema, </strong>Don Jazzy says he was discovered via <strong>Instagram. </strong>He says, â€œ<em>Dâ€™Prince dropped a song, â€˜Gucci Gang,â€™ featuring myself and David and the young man did a freestyle to it and tagged us. Thatâ€™s how everybody finds every artist; tag somebody, if the person is feeling you, you blow up.</em>â€�</p> <p class="">You can catch the chats on these time quotes; 11:38 – 12:45 and 25:55 – 26:38. </p> <p class="">On the podcast, he spoke about the Moâ€™ Hits Reunion concert and other interesting issues.
