 ADO-EKITIN –Â Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, the Ekiti State deputy governor, has warned members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) against involvement in acts that could destabilise the party. Egbeyemi, in a statement issued on Monday by Odunayo Ogunmola, his Special Assistant (Media), gave the warning while hosting a get-together for newly appointed political office holders from Ado Ekiti Local Government. He urged party members to love one another, refrain from peddling falsehood and never engage in pulling themselves down for whatever reason. Egbeyemi enjoined the appointees not to disappoint the Governor Kayode Fayemi, who appointed them to their positions and the people of the state whom they were chosen to serve. According to him, the offices held by the appointees carried huge responsibilities which must be diligently discharged to add value to governance and enhance the peopleâ€™s standard of living. â€œI want to warn you people against telling lies and destroying one another. We should stop saying bad things about ourselves and against this government. â€œWe must be united for our party to become stronger. We are all brothers and sisters. Let us love ourselves and avoid all forms of bitterness and hatred against fellow party members because we need unity to sustain our good performance in office.â€� Congratulating the party faithful for the success recorded in the last general elections, Egbeyemi said it was possible because they worked together as a team to ensure victory for all APC candidates. He stressed that Ado-Ekiti benefited immensely from the benevolence of Fayemi who, he said, appointed many indigenes of the town to enviable positions in appreciation of the votes recorded at the recently conducted elections.
