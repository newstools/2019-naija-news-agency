Earlier this week, Beijing authorities strongly opposed a meeting between the US National Security Advisor John Bolton and a high-ranking official from Taiwan. Chinese officials also rejected, in March, another statement by the United States House of Representatives about the 2019 Taiwan Warranty Act that is aimed at increasing the Taiwan international presence and strengthening its defense bonds. According to Wu Qian, both actions are an incitement to TaiwanÃ‚Â´s Chinese sovereignty, which Beijing will not bear to. As stated by Wu Qian, these US actions have seriously damaged the relations between both Asian nations, chipping away at peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. In 1971, the UN General Assembly passed, with 170 votes in favor, a resolution that deems the People’s Republic of China to be the only legitimate representative of Taiwan and recognizes the island as an inalienable part of China. To move forward to the all-out reunification of the national territory, Beijing also champions the One Country, two Systems policy, implemented successfully in the administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao. The Taiwanese high-ranking leaders, however, refuse to accept this status. The post China Rejects Any Foreign Interference In Taiwan appeared first on Independent Newspapers Nigeria.
