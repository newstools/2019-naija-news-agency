Moses Inwang’s Cold Feet has been on our radar since last year. Funny thing is, what we knew then was that Jim Iyke would go bald for the role. Now we have been given a trailer for the movie and a plot, and Iyke’s baldness. Unlike most Nollywood movie trailers, Cold FeetÂ isn’t hard to follow. Well, this means that the characters aren’t trying to out-shout each other. Cold Feet is directed from Moses Inwang. Remember him? He helmed the 2017 Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde ”comeback” film Alter Ego which, I have to say, was a mess. The trailer for Cold Feet opens with ex-military colonel, Mayowa (Jim Iyke) throwing a surprise birthday party for his wife Omoye, played by Joselyn Dumas.Â Afterwards, Mayowa flies Omoye to a vacation wherein she bumps into an old fame Tare (Enyinna Nwigwe) at a resort. Something is rekindled within Omoye, so much so that there’s a scene where she sneaks out of bed at night to be with Taye. They have sex, predictably. Cold Feet also stars Beverly Naya, who plays Taye’s wife. Ultimately, Omoye’s infidelity introduces a friction into her marriage to Mayowa. The story is rather basic, unless Inwang has wrapped up an element in the movie that will completely blindside us. Out in cinemas May 19, 2019, here’s the trailer below: Read Â» Jim Iyke, is that you? The trailer for Moses Inwang upcoming movie ‘Cold Feet’ is here on YNaija Jim Iyke, is that you?
