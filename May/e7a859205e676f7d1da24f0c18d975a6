 Manchester City have turned down a stunning Â£70.7million bid for Leroy Sane from Bundesliga champions Bayern Munch, claims The Guardian, according to Whoscored.com reports. Bayern have confirmed they are interested in signing Sane and are willing to shatter their club transfer record to land the Germany international. Niko Kovacâ€™s side are on the market for new wingers this summer following the joint departure of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. Bayern have been heavily linked with a move for Chelsea teenager Callum Hudson-Odoi all year and are now keen on Sane. Saneâ€™s future at City has been cast into doubt this season after dropping down the pecking order under Pep Guardiola. City have spent the last 12 months attempting to secure Saneâ€™s long-term future but are yet to make a breakthrough in contract talks. The fact Sane has dropped out of favour has done them no favours and now Bayern are hoping to take advantage of the situation. Cityâ€™s preference is to keep Sane and they have rejected Bayernâ€™s opening offer. However, Sane has two years left on his current City deal and they risk watching his value diminish if they fail to agree a new contract before the start of next season. Despite only starting 21 league games this season, Sane is the only player to register double figures for goals and assists in each of the last two Premier League campaigns.
