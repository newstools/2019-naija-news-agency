<p class="">Tonto Dikeh says she is going to beat fellow actress, Funke Adesiyan and there is no going back.</p> <h1>Okay guys, if you think Tonto Dikehs recent social media rants are going to slide anytime soon, then have a rethink as there might be a huge physical fight coming soon, as she plans to beat fellow actress, Funke Adesiyan.</h1> <p class="">The new rift between both actresses started off when Funke Adesiyan shared a post on her Instagram page which to a lot felt sounded like she was shading Tonto Dikeh. It didn’t take long before Tonto Dikeh responded by saying she was going to physically attack her when next she visits Lagos.</p> <p class=""><em>"Funke please say this to me when you see me. Keep this same energy too!!! I will break your mouth I promise. Don’t sub me if you ain’t bold enough to tag me!!!"</em> she wrote. It didn’t take long before Funke Adesiyan replied to Tonto’s threats.</p> <figure class="image" align="center">                  <img src="http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/ZTU7MDA_/00c825e5f670426e01d6f5d9a839d39b.jpg" alt="Drumbeats of war as Tonto Dikeh plans to beat Funke Adesiyan [Instagram/TontoDikeh]">                  <figcaption>Drumbeats of war as Tonto Dikeh plans to beat Funke Adesiyan [Instagram/TontoDikeh]</figcaption>                </figure> <p class=""><em>"@tontolet I want to believe you don’t mean it when you said you’d break my face.

I’ll tell you what I think of you, you are a depressed woman who hangs unto every straw of attention to remain relevant. True relevance come only when you stop seeking validation from people. You say you don’t care about what people think of you but it’s a big fat lie. You do care. That is the reason you grant countless interviews about your ex.
My dear, there’s so much you can become without the shadow of your ex. Break free and abound. The future is so big.
One advice for you, don’t come for me when you see me, you’d be sorry.
P.s my only response to you.</figcaption>                </figure> <p class=""><em>"True relevance comes only when you stop seeking validation from people.
