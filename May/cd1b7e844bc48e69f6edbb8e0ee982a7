 Abakaliki –Â A non-governmental organisation in Ebonyi State, Neo Black Movement of Africa Worldwide, has called on the state government to prioritise education, saying that an educated populace would shun any barbaric acts. The group was responding to the recent killings in some parts of the state, especially the Ikwo/Izzi clash where some persons were ambushed and killed by suspected Izzi warlords whom they described as â€˜illiterate and misguided youthsâ€� Okechukwu Mgbada, who is the leader of the group in Ebonyi, specifically identified lack of education among the youths as major reason they allow themselves to be used as war tools. He disclosed this to newsmen in Abakaliki on Monday while briefing them on the just concluded NBM African worldwide National convention at Abuja. Mgbada, who insinuated that the crisis was politically motivated, however, expressed optimism that the state governor, David Umahi, would end the crisis. He said, â€œI will say if you give the youth proper education they will not carry gun, if our youths are shown the way early they will not engage in evil practices. â€œSome of these things you see may be politically motivated. I heard of two brothers fighting. if you investigate it properly you will see that there is a stranger engineering that war.â€� â€œBut I believe that with our Governor and with our collaboration because we can only collaborate with government these crises will come to an end.â€� The post NGO Harps On Education As  Solution To Ebonyi Communal Wars NGO Harps On Education As  Solution To Ebonyi Communal Wars
