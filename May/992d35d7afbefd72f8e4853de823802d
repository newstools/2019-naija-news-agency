 The 2019 gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Abia State, Dr. Alex Otti, has described Governor Okezie Ikpeazu as a hypocrite who is bereft of milk of human kindness. Otti spoke against the backdrop of reported announcement by the Abia State government during this yearâ€™s Workersâ€™ Day celebration, that government was willing to pay the new N30,000 minimum wage recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. â€œHow are they going to do it? How are they going to pay N30,000 when they have not been able to pay N18,000?â€� Otti queried. He added: â€œIt is sheer hypocrisy for Abia State government, under Ikpeazu, to pay lip service to Abia workers that it was going to pay the new minimum wage, when it is currently owing workers between three months and 15 months salaries, in arrears.â€� The post Otti Slams Ikpeazu For Owing Abia Workers Otti Slams Ikpeazu For Owing Abia Workers
