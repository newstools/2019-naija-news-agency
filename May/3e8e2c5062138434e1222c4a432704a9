Every day on the Nigerian Internet, there are people who keep our eyes glued to our phone screens as we read their rants, opinions, perspectives on political and social issues, etc. Sometimes, they are just downright ridiculous. We make it our job to take down the names of these noisemakers. Here are the ones we saw today:  I’ve seen so many people on the TL say that Nigeria hates women. I don’t particularly agree with that. I think Nigeria hates anyone who isn’t of the ruling class, elite or related to those groups. I think it is more of a class issue than gender issue. â€” Faisal ‘Jajayomi (@JajaPhD) May 1, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js You constantly prove every day that you have nothing in your head.

I didn’t see this level outrage when the man went on the offensive. And I choose to not entertain it now that she’s gone nuclear.
