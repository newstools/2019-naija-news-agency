What she should realize is that every marriage has its own issue. No oneâ€™s marriage is perfect.</em></p> <p class=""><em>â€œIssues like that is private. It is very unbecoming of her to portray us in a bad light. There are so many actors who have issues with their marriages without getting the public involved. Her actions do not speak well of the industry.</em></p> <p class=""><em>â€œWe are not interested in her private matters; rather we are concerned about her attitude which is rubbing off negatively on other actresses.</em></p> <p class=""><em>â€œActions like this portray the industry as having unserious ladies. That is why men are scared of marrying actresses.</em></p> <p class=""><em>â€œThank God that we have good examples in the industry. If she is looking for sensation, she should look for something else to use.</em></p> <p class="">Tonto has, however, has reacted to the threat saying Ifeanyi should address more important issues in Nollywood.</p> <figure class="embedded_application" align="center">                  <figcaption>I hope this fastens your sanction from your board!!
