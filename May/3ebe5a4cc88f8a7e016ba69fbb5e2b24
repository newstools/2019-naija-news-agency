<p class="">The Association of Resident Doctors, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital (COOUTH), Awka branch, has embarked on indefinite strikeover poor conditions of service.</p> <h1>Dr Obinna Aniagboso, the Chairman of the branch, announced this in a statement on Monday in Awka.</h1> <p class="">He said the strike was caused by the inability of the Anambra Government to honour the agreement it signed with the body on Jan. 17, during its warning strike.</p> <p class="">Aniagboso said part of the agreement was for provision of adequate infrastructure that would improve clinical and diagnostic proficiency for improved patientâ€™s care and specialist training.</p> <p class="">He also listed completion and adoption of staff condition of service, including granting of In-service training to qualified medical officers and placement of staff on the appropriate salary scale with implementation of full welfare package as part of their grouse.</p> <p class="">According him, a considerable amount of patientsâ€™ investigations are outsourced at increased cost, the length of admission is increased and with the rising service cost, all translating into enormous financial burden for the common man.</p> <p class="">â€œ<em>It is on record that health workers in the hospital earn the least in the country, if not in the whole of West Africa.</em></p> <p class=""><em>â€œIt is also no news that doctors here earn below 50 per cent of their actual entitlement compared to their counterparts elsewhere.</em></p> <p class=""><em>â€œThis meager income hardly meets the bare necessities of life for the doctor and his family, let alone sponsoring professional examination and academic courses of Residency Programme.</em></p> <p class=""><em>â€œAgain, staff of the hospital has been subjected to professional stagnation, without promotion or progress since employment.</em></p> <p class=""><em>â€œFrustration and disgrace have led to steady exodus of highly qualified and experienced personnel, including consultants and senior residents, thus rendering the workforce unstable and undermined.</em></p> <p class=""><em>â€œTaking recourse to industrial action has never been our intention, but, unfortunately, we have been pushed to the wall for a long time and bruised, while efforts to get redress have proved abortive</em>,â€� Aniagboso said.</p> <p class="">He called on Gov. Willie Obiano of Anambra to wade into the situation and address the concerns of members.</p> <p class="">Reacting to the development, Dr Basil Nwankwo, the Chief Medical Director of COOUTH, explained that the industrial action was embarked upon by only the resident doctors.</p> <p class="">Nwankwo said that the situation did not ground activities at the hospital as consultants and House Officers were fully on duty to provide medical services to the public.</p> <p class=""><strong>ALSO READ</strong>: <a href="https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/islamic-state-reportedly-kills-11-soldiers-launches-fresh-attack-in-borno/fh8xhhq" id="f0891dc4-5ae8-4375-9d58-ace9956a4406">Islamic State reportedly kills 11 soldiers, launches fresh attack in Borno</a></p> <p class="">He however regretted the situation, saying that the state government is already engaging the resident doctors in order to find an immediate end to the strike.</p> <p class="">The CMD also expressed optimism that the renewed parley between the state government and striking doctors would lead to the end of the industrial action before Tuesday.</p>
