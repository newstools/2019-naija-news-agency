 The Supreme court of Singapore on Monday granted the release of Adili Ejike, a Nigerian man onÂ death row for drug trafficking in the country after eight years of being convicted of the crime. Ejike was sentenced to death by hanging for allegedly smuggling in almost two kilograms of meth into Singapore in 2011. At the time of his incarceration, Ejike had insisted that he wasn’t aware that the bag that was given to him by his childhood friend in Nigeria to deliver to an unknown contact in Singapore was containing drug. The prosecutor had argued that he was aware of the content of the bag, but failed to prove that he indeed had knowledge of the substance. “Both the prosecutor and the defence agreed that he was in possession of the drugs, which was sufficient to convict him and affirm the death sentence earlier passed on him by both the lower and appellate courts,â€� the head of Nigeria High Commission in Singapore,Â Akinremi Bolaji said. However,Â in recent review of the judgment by the Supreme Court, Ejike was freed and acquitted of all charges brought against him. â€œThe Immigration Services of Singapore would release Ejike to travel to Nigeria on Wednesday, May 29, on board of Ethiopian Airlines and should be arriving in Lagos to join his family in Anambra, afterwards,” Bolaji confirmed. Nigerians have been advised to be careful or avoid carrying any luggage that they did not pack by themselves while traveling abroad.
