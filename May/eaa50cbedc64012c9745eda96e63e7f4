 UGHELLI –Â Amb. Jude Ebitimi Ukori, Executive Chairman, Egbema and Gbaramatu Communities Development Foundation (EGCDF), has called on International Oil Companies (IOCs) operating in the Niger Delta to renegotiate with host communities since the Federal Government decided that gold mining companies in the northern states should consult host communities before gold mining licences could be granted. He said this was very urgent and necessary because the Federal Government could not continue to decide over the oil and gas resources in the south, while giving the north a free hand over their own resources. According to him, the decision of the Federal Government on gold mining companies in the northern states showed that the Federal Government had been operating a different constitution when it concerned the Niger Delta States. It would be recall that the Federal Government recently declared that it would not issue fresh permits to solid minerals mining firms in Nigeria to mine for more minerals if they did not have the consent of their host communities. The Federal Government, through the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, also stated that the government had reviewed the countryâ€™s Mining and Mineral Act of 2007, and fixed some of the loopholes that were identified in it such that it could now compete well with any mining laws in the world. But, Ukori at the EGCDF office in Effurun, Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State, while addressing journalists, asked if the Federal Government had been operating separate constitutions for the north and south, where communities in the north were authorised to mine their gold, especially in Zamfara State, while the oil and gas in the South South had been an exclusive reserve for the Federal Government.
