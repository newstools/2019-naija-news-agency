It was Mothers’ Day in USA yesterday but all over the world, people joined in on the celebration, because mothers deserve to be celebrated everyday. We have gone ahead to compile all the amazing heart-warming mothers’ day messages from Nigerian celebrities. No work? “She’s so lazy.” Work? “Stay home and take care of the family.” No child. “Not a real woman.” Child. “Why did she start something she’s not ready for?” No money. “Liability”. Money. “The man is the provider. What is she looking for.” No class. “Illiterate”. Class. “Snob”. No ambition. “Waste.” Ambition. “She doesn’t know her place.” . As far as I’m confirmed, every woman is a mother because of her ability to nurture and bring to life magic, from her heart, with her hands, from her womb, by her patience, in her sacrifice. So Happy Mother’s Day to you Queen A post shared by  Simi (@symplysimi) on May 12, 2019 at 7:52am PDT Happy Motherâ€™s Day ! LOVE YOU ALL A post shared by  Davido Adeleke (@davidoofficial) on May 12, 2019 at 9:53am PDT My mother never really sat me down to teach me life lessons, but she lived her life as an example that has brought me so much goodness. Then, God blessed me with an amazing wife, @hautestacy to compliment and support me through the continuous journey of life as I keep learning more. These and more are what make true mothers absolutely essential and wonderful. Happy Mother’s day to all the great women who have impacted our lives and more. God bless you all.
