 Busola Dakolo, celebrity photographer and wife of Nigerian soul singer Timi Dakolo, has formally filed a complaint with the Nigeria Police against the senior pastor of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, whom she accused of raping her while she was a teenager. With her complaint, the Police has commenced an investigation into the allegation. Recall that Pastor Fatoyinbo on Monday announced a leave of absence from the pulpit in order to clear his name from the rape scandal involving him and Bukola. This followed a protest march by a civil society group, ‘Church Too’ movement demanding justice for Busola Dakolo and rape victims allegedly abused sexually by the embattled cleric.
