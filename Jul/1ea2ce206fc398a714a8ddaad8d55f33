It was really wild. But no one was really surprised. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp had a glitch – people couldn’t load photos/votes, some couldn’t share posts, and others had issues sending messages. Instagram and Facebook even took to Twitter to apologise and update their users about the issue: We’re aware that some people are having trouble uploading or sending images and videos on Instagram. We're sorry for the trouble and are working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible. #instagramdown — Instagram (@instagram) July 3, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js We’re aware that some people are having trouble uploading or sending images, videos and other files on our apps. We're sorry for the trouble and are working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible. #facebookdown — Facebook (@facebook) July 3, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As usual, people, including the CIA, came to Twitter to banter about the whole situation.
