 Tottenham have tabled an offer worth £20.6m in cash plus Toby Alderweireld for the signature of Liverpool target Nicolo Zaniolo. Zaniolo has emerged as one of the most highly-rated youngsters in Italian football since joining AS Roma from Inter Milan last summer as the 20-year-old forced his way into their starting eleven with a string of impressive performances accordingto reports in Italy via The Sun. The attacking midfielder contributed 6 goals and 2 assists in his 36 appearances in all competitions last season and he made his debut for the senior Italian national team back in March after being given a call-up by boss Roberto Mancini. Zaniolo’s huge potential has alerted clubs here in the Premier League as The Sun are citing a report from Corriere dello Sport that claims Tottenham and Liverpool have both expressed an interest in the midfielder. Jurgen Klopp is only expected to make minor changes to his Champions League winning squad this summer and a midfielder isn’t thought to be a priority so the Italian publication says Liverpool were hoping to wait until next summer before formalising their interest in Zaniolo. However, that’s likely to be too late as Corriere dello Sport claims the youngster is expected to leave Roma this summer and Tottenham have now tabled a firm offer worth £20.6m [€23m] in cash plus they’ve included Alderweireld as part of the deal.
