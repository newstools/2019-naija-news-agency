 Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted he will not buy a direct replacement for Ander Herrera as Andreas Pereira and Scott McTominay are ready to step up after the Spaniard’s departure. Herrera joined Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer at the start of July after failing to agree on a new deal at Old Trafford. Solskjaer was desperate to keep Herrera but United would not meet his £200,000-a-week wage demands and the Norwegian had identified Newcastle’s Sean Longstaff as a replacement. However, the Magpies have slapped a £50m price tag on the 21-year-old and the Red Devils are unwilling to pay that much for a midfielder that has just eight Premier League appearances to his name. With the market proving frustrating for Solskjaer, the 46-year-old has suggested that the club will not buy a replacement for Herrera and will instead look to McTominay and Pereira. Asked if James Garner would be part of his plans this season, Solskjaer replied: ‘Jimmy is young, he’s very young — only 18 — so you can’t expect too much from him but you can see he is going to be a top player. ‘Andy [Pereira] I expect a lot more from, Scotty [McTominay] I expect a lot more from. Those two between them had maybe 15, 20 starts last season. ‘You expect them to have at least 20 each this year, maybe even more. That’s maybe two players into one that can replace Ander [Herrera].’ United have made just two signings this summer with Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James joining for a combined £72m. Solskjaer hopes to make at least two further signings but there could be additional incomings if the likes of Romelu Lukaku are sold.
