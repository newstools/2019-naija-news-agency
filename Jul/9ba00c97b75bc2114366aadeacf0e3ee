 Mavin’s Rema and YBNL’s Fireboy DML are currently the most in-from young artistes presently in the Nigerian music industry and are being touted to take over the reigns from Davido and Wizkid in the coming years. Both artistes have done brilliantly since they were introduced into the music industry few months back with some music releases that have shaken the music industry already this year. Like Davido and Wizkid have done, they are gradually occupying spaces in the hearts of new generation fans which is evident in the brilliant reception they get when they go play shows and events. With the enormous attention these two talented young artistes are having, people are already predicting that there is only just a limited time left for Davido & Wizkid at the helms of affairs of music in the industry as these two young ones would dethrone them soon. Some are even boldly claiming in 3 years time that there won’t be rave around Davido & Wizkid again as it would be strictly Rema & Fireboy which we find a little unbelievable. Nevertheless, we would love to have your opinion on what you think about this topic, do you think in the next 3 years, Rema & Fireboy must have overtaken Wizkid & Davido as the biggest artistes in Nigeria?
