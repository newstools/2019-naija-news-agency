 Barely 48-hours after the manner in which a police invitation was served to Timi Dakolo and his wife, Busola led to another stint of outrage on social media, the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has ordered that petitions from Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, and that of the Dakolos, be merged and investigated at the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Alagbon, Ikoyi, Lagos. Mr Femi Falana, counsel to the Dakolos confirmed report of the case transfer and according to him, this was because the singer’s family were the first to petition the police. Punch reported that he further assured that justice will be served. This is coming after LIB reported that Timi Dakolo alleged that the letter of ‘invitation for questioning’ he was served over the weekend, came after Pastor Fatoyinbo allegedly bribed investigating officials to delay summons, and also pushed for the case to be transferred to Abuja.
