 Watford are making progress in their bid to sign Rennes winger Ismaila Sarr for a club-record fee. Rennes have already turned down a €30 million (£27m/$34m) bid from Watford for Sarr, but the Senegal international is keen to move to Vicarage Road according to L’Equipe. Talks are ongoing between the two clubs as Watford also look to agree the terms on a contract with Sarr and his representatives. The post Watford Step Up Sarr Bid  Source: Independent
