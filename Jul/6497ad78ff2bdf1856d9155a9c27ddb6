 A video of two yet-to-be identified Access bank staffs  at its University of Lagos branch have drawn serious reactions online after they were caught getting intimate in the office during closing hours. The couple seemed to have forgotten to pull down the window blinds, before ‘engaging’ in the act in office which was captured on camera by residents of the area.  Sharing the video on Twitter, @Princeebuka7 wrote; So away from the trending mike, tacha, frodd, seyi, tuoyo and the rest… Here’s what happened tonight live at @myaccessbank UnilagPlease i day una, dnt sack them.
