 Look around you, how many things have changed since the beginning of this year? How many of your goals have you achieved so far? Have you reached more milestones? Have you discovered more ways to get closer to your dreams? Six months into 2019, Access Bank’s message has remained consistent along the lines of urging its customers to be more and to accomplish more. The bank’s impact, which cuts across all sectors of the society, has yet again gained international recognition. The bank clinched this year’s GBA Women’s Market Champion Impact Award. The award comes on the heels of the numerous contributions made by Access Bank’s Women Banking team towards empowering women and bettering the lives of its female customers, irrespective of location or socio-economic class. The award which was presented by the Global Banking Alliance for Women (GBA), now more recently referred to as Financial Alliance for Women, is given each year to outstanding GBA member institutions for innovatively catering to women customers and providing financial services that position them better economically and otherwise. Through its W Initiative, Access Bank has created numerous products offerings like the “W Power Loan” which disburses friendly loans to female-owned businesses; “W Academy” which trains, coaches and mentors women in diverse career fields; and Maternal Health Service Support (MHSS) which offers unique medical loans for women. In the same vein, the bank hosted a trail-blazing International Women’s Day Conference earlier this year with over 15 seasoned guest speakers and industry experts in attendance. Every woman with ambitions and dreams needs a reliable financial partner for support every step of the way. There is no alternative to receiving the best services because every woman deserves more.
