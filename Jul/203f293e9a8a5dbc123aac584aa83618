Yesterday, we told the story of how rapper, Olamide was allegedly expecting a child with former Beat FM OAP, Maria Okan in a month’s time, but Maria is supposed to have had an abortion.  More information about the two has been shared again today. Instabloggist9ja on Instagram today said that they had a source who told them that Maria Okan was supposed to abort the child she is now carrying. According to the account, Olamide had given Maria 2 Million Naira to abort the child she was carrying. They claim that Maria had taken the money, flew to the UK and refused to abort the baby. They claim that their ‘credible insider’ source said that it was Maria that had asked for the money for the abortion but then changed her mind about it. They claim that Maria deciding to breach the agreement she initially made with the rapper caused major tension in his relationship with his fiancee. However, they claim that Olamide’s fiancee, Bukunmi has forgiven him for the indiscretion and knows that there is a baby on the way. Both Maria Okan and Olamide are still yet to make a comment about the paternity of the child. They have also not made any comments as to the authenticity of the abortion claims either. Social media, on the other hand, is divided with whose side they are on about this issue. We would like to know what you think about this situation in the comment section.
