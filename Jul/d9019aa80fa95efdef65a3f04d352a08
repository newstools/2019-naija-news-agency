 An Orthodox Jewish man from Stamford Hill has been found guilty of sexually assaulting young girls he met on social media, According to Jewishnews.timesofisrael.com. Abraham Yousef, 21, of Woodmill Road, is known throughout the Orthodox area as Avi Karni, a Yemenite Jew brought to the UK as a child by London’s Satmar leaders. He was arrested in September last year after the parents of a 14-year old girl found indecent images on her phone, and at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Monday he was found guilty of a string of sexual offences. These included causing a child to engage in sexual activity, sexual communication with a child, meeting a child following sexual grooming, two counts of sexual activity with a child, three counts of possessing an indecent image of a child and attempting to sexually communicate with a child. His brother Yousef, 29, was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice, after he contacted one of the victims after Abraham’s arrest and put pressure on her to change her story. Both men will be sentenced on 27 September. “Abraham Ibrahim was a lone, opportunist offender who targeted his young victims on social media platforms knowing they were vulnerable, pursuing them for his own sexual gratification,” said Det Insp Mark Rogers, who led the investigation. “Yousef Abraham has tried to influence the course of the investigation. His actions were utterly reckless, misguided, and resulted in his conviction. I like would to praise the children and their families who have shown great courage in supporting the investigation and giving evidence in a difficult and traumatic court case.” The post 21-Year-Old Found Guilty Of Sexually Assaulting Girls He Met Online  Source: Independent
