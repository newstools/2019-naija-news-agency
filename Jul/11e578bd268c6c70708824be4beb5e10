 STREAM/DOWNLOAD MP3 Juls ft. Mr Eazi – Cake Lyrics [Intro]
Juls Baby [Chorus]
Trap trap trap in a bundle
Too much cake for your back o
Somebody ring alarm o
Somebody call police o, eeii
Trap trap trap in a bundle
Too much cake for your back o
Somebody ring alarm o
Somebody call police o, eeii [Verse 1]
You dey give me that feeling
This your baka e go kill me
Yeah yeah yeah
So girl you got me falling, falling
Like I hear your body calling, calling
You know am a trying to bag it
Your body be the baddest
Yeah yeah yeah yeah [Chorus]
Trap trap trap in a bundle (in a bundle)
Too much cake for your back o (back o)
Somebody ring alarm o
Somebody call police o, eeii
Trap trap trap in a bundle
Too much cake for your back o
Somebody ring alarm o
Somebody call police o, eeii [Verse 2]
Sex on the roof does it cherry on top
Drink up the love to the very last drop
Anything you like
Give me a sugar rush tonight
Girl I want you naked below talking diamond chains
Coz you’re such a fuckin’ lady
I like it, I like it
So girl you got me falling, falling
Like I hear your body calling, calling
You know am trying to bag it
Your body be the baddest
Yeah yeah yeah yeah [Chorus]
Trap trap trap in a bundle (in a bundle)
Too much cake for your back o
Somebody ring alarm o
Somebody call police o, eeii
Trap trap trap in a bundle
Too much cake for your back o
Somebody ring alarm o
Somebody call police o, eeii [Outro]
Too much cake for your back o
Somebody call police o
Too much cake for your back o
Somebody call police
