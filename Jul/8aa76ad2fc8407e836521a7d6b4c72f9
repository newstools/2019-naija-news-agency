 Summer is everyone’s favourite season! Asides from the sun being super bright and constantly smiling back at you, you have to love the fun activities that come with it; the aesthetically pleasing landscapes, the fruits that come out in season and of course, for the ladies who love fashion, you look forward to the bright-coloured clothes you get to wear. It’s generally a bright time of the year where everything feels right. However, nothing feels more right than being able to push the boundaries of your style/wardrobe. Whether you’re going to be on vacay or stay-cation, don’t look too far because the Summer Elixir Collection by Retroluux has fabulous styles that will make this summer the truly grandest one.
