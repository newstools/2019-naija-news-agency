 Gavin and Stacey stars Joanna Page and Mathew Horne have been seen shooting romantic scenes on Wales’ infamous Barry Pier for the sitcom’s Christmas special.
The pair, who play the married title characters, were spotted standing among dozens of illuminated snowmen and twinkling lights on Friday night. The 42-year-old actress and 40-year-old Bad Education star looked to be in their element as they geared up for the first day of filming for the highly anticipated Christmas special.
The on-screen couple were seen in high spirits as they shared in-jokes and laughed, clearly delighted to be reunited. ames Cordon, who co-created the show and plays Gavin’s best mate Smithy, was also in attendance for filming but remained behind the camera.
James, 40, was seen putting a finger to his mouth to shush people when the noise levels went out of control, and was later seen capturing snippets of the action on his mobile phone. It remains unclear if he was recording clips for his social media or personal use. Love Actually star Joanna was spotted in a festive outfit of red midi dress and plum coloured patterned coat, despite the summer temperatures at the moment.
She completed her look with pearl earrings and a pair of ankle strap heels.
Mathew was seen in his character’s typical get up of dark jeans, tan shoes, a grey top and a short black and red tartan Harrington jacket. It is not the first time the Gavin and Stacey cast have been spotted filming in the Welsh seaside town.
More scenes for the hotly-anticipated Christmas special – which was confirmed by the BBC in May – were filmed earlier on Friday. The final season of the beloved show finished with Smithy stopping Nessa and Dave’s wedding, and Stacey discovering she was pregnant.
The final scenes showed the much-loved foursome gathered six-months later on Barry’s beach.
It is hoped that the Christmas special will give fans some closure nine years since the last episode aired by finally telling them what happened next. The Gavin and Stacey Christmas Special will air on Christmas Day on BBC One.
