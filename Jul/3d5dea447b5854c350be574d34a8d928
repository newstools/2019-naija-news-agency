 Congratulations are in order for EastEnders actress Lacey Turner, as she’s welcomed her first child with her husband Matt Kay. Lacey, who plays the role of iconic character Stacey Slater in the hit soap, has welcomed a healthy baby girl following two heartbreaking miscarriages.
According to OK! Magazine, Lacey and her husband Matt welcomed their bundle of joy on Friday 12th July, with the couple said to be ‘”over the moon and filled with joy”. Marnie Simpson announced she was pregnant with her first child with boyfriend Casey Johnson in April, after fearing she was infertile. Stacey, who married her husband Matt back in 2017, first announced she was expecting a baby in February 2019.
Opening up to OK! Magazine after suffering two miscarriages in the past, Lacey said, “I can’t wait to nurture our baby – we’ve dreamed of having a family for so long.” Emmerdale: Lydia Hart faces her past

Speaking about the couple’s previous heartbreak, Lacey added, “When you’ve lost babies all you care about is the heartbeat, we’ve had about 12 scans. It felt like my whole world had fallen to pieces and there’s nothing you can do apart from try and put it back together.
“I blamed myself thinking that I’d done something wrong. I’d think, why me? What did I do? But, of course, I hadn’t done anything wrong – it’s all down to chromosomes and luck, really.”
At the time of publication, Lacey and Matt are yet to share any further details about their newborn daughter, including her name or any photos.
