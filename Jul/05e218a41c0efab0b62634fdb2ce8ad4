Air France has introduced an upgraded cabin interior on its Airbus A330 fleet and I’m getting an exclusive first look to check it out. Hi, I’m Adesola Ade-Unuigbe, BellaNaija’s Head of Content.  In a few short hours, I’m going to be up in the air, sipping champagne, eating a three-course meal and relaxing in complete comfort in the all-new KLM and Air France business class cabins. Jealous? Don’t be! I’m making sure that you can follow my journey every step of the way and experience everything with me. Here’s what you need to know about my trip: For the next three days, I will be exploring the luxurious facilities of KLM and Air France – both in the air and on the ground. I will start with a discovery of the newly redesigned Air France Business Class lounge at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos. Then, it will be time to explore the KLM World Business Class cabin, with a flight from Lagos to Amsterdam. In Amsterdam, I’ll walk you through the new Crown business class lounge and connect with a KLM flight to Paris. And in Paris, oh Paris! I will explore the city – I’m especially looking forward to my Instagram-worthy photos near the Eiffel Tower. After a fun day of wining and dining, I’ll leave Paris to head back to Lagos. But first – I’ll be treated to an airport tour and discovery of the new Business lounge. On my flight back to Lagos, it’ll be yummy treats and special care on the new A330 cabins.
