 Sevilla striker Wissam Ben Yedder is holding out for a move to Manchester United or PSG after rejecting a Chinese side, it is claimed. The France international has apparently turned down Beijing Synobo Guoan in a deal that would have seen him earn as much as €1m-a-month as he is aware of interest from Europe’s top clubs. Spanish outlet Marca (who cite L’Equipe) are claiming that United and PSG have both reached out to the player’s agent in order to gauge interest over a potential move this summer. ABC de Sevilla ran a report last month claiming that the Red Devils are debating the idea of moving for Ben Yedder to try and replace Romelu Lukaku, who looks set for a move to Italy. The 28-year-old meanwhile has revealed that his intentions are to move to a top club in the current transfer window. “I dream of playing at the highest level, in the biggest clubs in the world and being next to world class players,” Ben Yedder explained earlier this month (as per ABC de Sevilla). “I want to see how far I can go and it is the right time (to leave), as they say. “I cannot be disrespectful to the club, whatever the final decision, I’ll be fine, I’m not worried about my future. “I will take stock after the international fixtures, but it will also be Sevilla who decide.” The former Toulouse star scored a brace in Sevilla’s Champions League last-16 victory against United a season ago, and is believed to be worth in the region of €40million (£36m).
