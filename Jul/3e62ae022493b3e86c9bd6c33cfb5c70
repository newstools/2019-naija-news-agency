 A gold fish has no hiding place; so the age-old adage goes. Even with his senatorial court case still ongoing, the former two-time governor of Akwa Ibom State, and distinguished senator of his Akwa Ibom North West Senatorial District, Godswill Akpabio made a unanimous return with his name on the new President Muhammadu Buhari’s ministerial nominees’ list. While he awaits his confirmation as a minister, which he is sure to get, his victory at the tribunal on his much-cherished senatorial victory, will give him a deserved nationwide acceptance as a politician and elder statesman of note. Akapbio remains one of the most garlanded Governors in the nation’s recent history, for his uncommon transformation of Akwa Ibom State. Even years after leaving as helmsman of the “Land of Promise’’ state, Akpabio’s light still continues to glow, as his footprints remain invisible and rightly so. Senator Akpabio is a man of proven integrity and love for the masses. His presence and contributions to the federal ruling party, is an indication that he has all the pedigree to signpost a new dimension for the country and his darling state Akwa Ibom as an agent of change. Can anyone question his capacity in the nation’s evolution? Definitely, no one can.
