On his part, the defendant who resides at Nasarawa area of Kaduna agreed that he had divorced Rukayya, but urged the court to allow him to keep all his children together. He said he would not be able to provide separate money for the upkeep of the two children as demanded by his ex-wife. The Judge, Malam Murtala Nasir after listening to both parties, confirmed the divorce between the couple and granted custody of the two children to the complainant. The judge ordered the defendant to pay N7,000 monthly feeding allowance for the two children and return them to their mother within seven days. “The defendant should note that he is responsible for his children’s health, school and clothing and should pay for their feeding at the beginning of every month”, he said.
