 Jurgen Klopp’s agent has admitted his client would like to manage the German national team one day, but insists he is currently more than happy at Liverpool. Klopp is one of the most in-demand managers in world football due to his sensational work at Anfield that culminated in the Reds winning the Champions League last month and finishing last season with 97 points. He has been linked with Juventus and Real Madrid this summer, rumours he himself dismissed as bull****, but agent Marc Kosicke believes the German job could be the one to lure him away from Anfield in future. Jurgen himself once said that in the event that Joachim Low someday no longer wants to be the national coach and it would be possible for him do that, this is an option for him,’ he told German outlet Welt In the summer of 2016 Klopp and his coaching staff signed six-year extensions to their deals keeping them at Liverpool until 2022 and there is no suggestion he is considering quitting before that expires. Kosicke admits his client has no desire to leave Liverpool before his deal runs out and it would be hard for a club to pay the funds required to bring him away. He added: ‘Liverpool would even like to extend it (his current contract). ‘He felt again at the recent celebrations [after winning the Champions League] what a great club Liverpool is and that he is in the right place at the right time. ‘Jurgen is currently not affordable. But it is difficult to measure the transfer fee in his case anyway. ‘How is this going to work for a coach who has increased the club’s value from nearly £900 million to just under £2.8billion? That is not how it works.’ It was reported by the The Sun on Saturday night that Liverpool fears Klopp’s concerns of burning out will prevent him from signing a new deal. Klopp is believed to earn around £7million a year and Fenway Sports Group have made an approach to raise his salary to £10m following Liverpool’s Champions League triumph. Club owners are keen to reward Klopp with another six-year deal extension worth £60m, which would also ward off any raid from their European rivals.
