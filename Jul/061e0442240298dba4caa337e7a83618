It’s fair to say that Leicester City have had one of the more interesting summers so far. Between signing Youri Tielemans on a permanent transfer and trying to make Manchester United pay £80m for Harry Maguire, they’ve certainly been busy. Brendan Rodgers is unlikely to be happy with just Tielemans and Ayoze Perez arriving, though, as he looks to add to the squad ahead of an attempt on the top six next season. And it seems he’s particularly keen on another attacking midfielder, with Ansa Liguria reporting that Leicester is making moves for Sampdoria midfielder Dennis Praet. They claim the Foxes have already seen an opening bid of €18m plus bonuses rejected by the Serie A side, who are holding out for €25m for the Belgian. However, even if Leicester are willing to pay that amount, they may face a fight to convince him to move to England. CalcioMercato report that Praet ‘is not particularly teased by England’ and would prefer to join a club with big goals and ‘the chance to participate in the cups.’ The latter presumably means the Europa League or Champions League. The Foxes also face competition for his signature with Valencia an admirer and Arsenal also having looked at him in the past few weeks. Those two can offer European football with CalcioMercato saying Valencia, in particular, would be to Praet’s ‘personal satisfaction’. That suggests that he’s already eyeing up a move to La Liga and even if Leicester can get a deal done with his club, he’s looking elsewhere. Having convinced Tielemans already this summer, though, you couldn’t rule out Rodgers doing the same with this midfielder should it come to that.
