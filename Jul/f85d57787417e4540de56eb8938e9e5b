The governor affirmed that there is no going back on development of grazing reserves in the state because it is the best solution to curtail the Herders/Farmers conflicts and to also develop one of our areas of comparative economic advantage. “We will develop our grazing reserves where we can keep the herders and provide the infrastructure so that they can get better yield with regards to milk and beef,” he stated. Bello confirmed that the state government will, in the next three months, flag off its over 30,000 hectares grazing reserve in Bobi, Mariga Local Government Area of the State, saying: “government is also in the process of gazetting seven other grazing reserves in parts of the State.” “ We have about 20 grazing reserves in the state, only two (Bobi and Girin) have been gazetted  but hopefully, overtime, we will develop others”, he noted. He stated further  that developing the grazing reserves also provides opportunity to the private sector to invest and put in daily services in the diary and beef production assuring that, shortly, the state will start showcasing that the project is economically viable and can also address conflicts between herders and farmers. “I think, in the long run we are on the right track and we are getting all the necessary support from the CBN. Hopefully, within the shortest possible time, we’ll see some result”, he noted. Also , in her contribution, the Deputy Governor of CBN,  Aisha Ahmad Ndanusa explained that the initiative would create job opportunities for entrepreneurs at different levels and encourage economic empowerment, particularly for the women and youths.
