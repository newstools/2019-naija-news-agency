 It was a Sunday night and Washington’s large Capital One Arena was packed. But it wasn’t packed for basketball or a music concert; it was 20,000 people who came to listen to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. It was at this moment when on a cultural level, decades of mistrust and bad blood between Pakistan and the United States (US) evaporated. Prior to the formation of Imran’s government, Pakistan’s prime ministers were the kind of people who could only fill large public squares at home by mobilising a network of bribery and patronage. Such politicians could not attract any great attention abroad or in places where the system of feudal political patronage does not exist. But the people who came to listen to Imran were not paid or coaxed; many in fact came from all over the US at their own cost in order to see Imran in the flesh. When he took to the stage, flanked by both a Pakistan and American flag, it was as though a new era was born – one which carried with it the spirit of the 1980s, which was the last time that Pakistan and the US cooperated on an equal footing against a clearly defined and easily recognisable common enemy. What’s more is that when speaking of a desire to create opportunities for Pakistanis to advance their worldly condition on a level playing field, he was speaking the language of political optimism that once defined American politics. But whilst American politics grows ever more cynical, Imran assured his audience of 20,000 that a forward looking ‘Naya Pakistan’ is being built for them and for their children. Although most of the audience were Pakistani-Americans, there were surely a good number of Americans in the arena present with no connection to Pakistan. This of course includes those working at the large facility. They too would have seen and heard Imran and they would have realised that the man before them was speaking American insofar as celebrity is a major element of the broader American culture. More importantly, Donald Trump, who shortly awaits his meeting with Imran, would have seen the footage. Above all else, Trump likes someone who looks and acts like a success. As someone who himself packs arenas for frequent political rallies, Trump will likewise recognise in Imran someone who is a formidable figure with a global appeal.
