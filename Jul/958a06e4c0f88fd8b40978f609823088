  6 Shiites, Precious Owolabi, & a Deputy Commission of Police Die in a Peaceful Protest It’s the kind of thing that happens in Nigeria, people dying in a peaceful protest. The Shiites, as usual, had been protesting the continued detainment of their leader Ibrahim El-Zakzaky in Abuja. The protesters claimed the officers attacked them. a source claimed the protesters threw petrol bombs. The DCP was allegedly shot when he was pacifying the protesters, but photos show the back of his head as the entry point of the bullet. Precious Owolabi, a corps member serving with Channels Television was “hit by bullets.” What’s important to note is that so many died, and nothing has been done to prevent more deaths. El-Zakzaky is still being detained. The Shiites will continue to protest. Probably, security officials will continue to open fire on them. Some people really believed that Shiites shot a police man on Monday. They meant Shiites on that day, about a thousand of them, went with only one gun and one bullet. They shot only the Late DCP.

It’s easy! Here’s how! Campaign aggressively for the incumbent president who runs for a second term. You don’t have to have a great track record or be a technocrat like the country needs—who cares? All you need to do is help defeat your brother in your state elections. Or you can either be an outgoing state governor who helps the president win your state by a margin of 10,000 votes. Or you might have even been been writing press releases and fighting haters on Twitter. That’s perfectly all right. Next thing, you’re a minister! See? Easy.

In the video, one of the aid workers, who identified herself as Grace appealed to the federal government and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) to assist in securing her release. She’s the only Christian among the six, she revealed, and the last Christian captured by the sect, Leah Sharibu, had died, she said. It’s funny, how most people had little to say about the six women now in captivity. All attention was on Leah’s reported death. The presidency released a statement saying their attention has been called to the video, and contact is being made. Whatever that is supposed to mean. Let’s not do this please. There is a place for the criticism of religious fanaticism and how we use it as a crutch for Nigeria’s bedeviling ills. Leah Sharibu’s refusal to recant her faith is not the place for this. She died because evil terrorists killed her. — K (@Damocleansword) July 26, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The exalted cowardice used to blame Leah Sharibu is the cowardice that keeps a lot of us quiet in the face of injustice or evil for the fear of losing out social standing or even our livelihoods.
