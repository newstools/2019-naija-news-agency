Schhh…Schweppes, a symbol of style since 1783, is changing the face of sophisticated luxury parties with a series of beautifully curated experiences tagged Schweppervesence. A reinvention of the timeless art of ‘mixing’, Schweppervesence takes guests on the ultimate mixer experience, flagged by Schweppes’ exciting new variants: Virgin Mojito, Pineapple and Chapman.  The maiden edition of Schweppervesence was held at Twin Waters Lekki, Lagos, showcasing Schweppes sparkle, effervescence, character and style, with guests like Beverly Naya, Illrymz, DJ Neptune helping to the dial-up the refined palate and charm of Schweppes. Elite mixologist, Laura Rawa, explained how each sparkling variant of Schweppes sits perfectly alongside the finest spirits, wines, and champagnes: “Schweppes variants are uniquely curated to fit every refined palate. Virgin mojito mixes seamlessly with rum; the delicious taste of Chapman and Bitter Lemon are perfect for vodka; while Pineapple and tequila are a match made in cocktail heaven.
