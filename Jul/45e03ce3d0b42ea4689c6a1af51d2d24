On the proactive Ondo lawmaker ONE of the attributes to look out for in a credible leader is whether the person is living by the principles and his words or how urgently he attends to the problems facing his people. The newly elected Ese Odo lawmaker in Ondo State promised to serve his people very well. It takes a very principled man like Hon Success Torhukerhijo to live by his words by immediately visiting the victims of a recent domestic fire outbreak when it got to his attention that a 70-year-old woman, Mrs Moyo Jide and her four grandchildren were involved in a fire accident. Though it is a tragedy, the incident has shown that the lawmaker takes his commitment seriously and is a caring politician with a high sense of moral values, especially when he deemed it his duty to provide the family the necessary relief materials to rebuild the burnt structure with a promise to give them more support. The lawmaker should not make a detour from this path that he has started to tread so that his constituents will enjoy the dividends of democracy Jimoh Mumin Esq.
