 The Oriental hotel was graced with class and style on July 4th, as an urbane beauty brand, Luscious by Lisa formally launched its range of beauty products. The brand unveiled two products for natural looking pink lips – Luscious by Lisa lip cream and Luscious by Lisa lip gloss. A premium photo lounge decked in black carpet was curated to usher in guests who arrived looking dapper in black and gold, the colors for the night. Hosts for the night were the delectable Osas Ighodaro and the classy Tobi Bakre who teamed up to give guests a classy evening.  The hall was decorated in black and gold, setting the mood for a cocktail evening that was all about style and elegance.  Two bars served up a variety of cocktails, the Moet & Chandon signature and a “settle in” bar. A grand piano was set up unmistakably, giving a rendition of classics from timeless movies and tunes from our motherland. Celebrities who graced the occasion include Denola Grey, Timini Egbuson and a host of others.  The launch unveiled the Lip cream which gently and naturally lightens dark lips, making them supple, soft and luscious while the lip gloss adds shine and a natural glow to last you throughout the day.
