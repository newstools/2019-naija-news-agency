 BNS: Why did you start your line? My creative abilities derive from early childhood as I watched my mother and grandmother doing some needlework as a hobby. I was extremely fascinated that a garment could be produced by hand and I joined them and wanted to make more out of it.  BNS: Who is your favorite celebrity or influencer to work with? Unfortunately I Love them all, I can’t choose one because each and every celebrity/ influencer has their own unique energy and in that energy we connect in the best way ever and there is a magnificent synergy which makes it so easy for us to collaborate in making the best works of art where we join forces as two brands.  BNS: How would you describe your label? It’s a celebration of distinctive style and brand identity, that always wins recognition and acclaim on an international scale. BNS: What do you believe should be the foundation of every woman’s wardrobe? I definitely believe that a staple to every woman’s closet is a perfect fitting dress that is something that can be worn to a corporate event or the office or a family function which is so transeasonal and versatile and it makes her feel so good every time she wears it without adding a lot of things on it and makes a statement on its own.  BNS: Who is the Orapeleng Modutle woman? She loves to express her own romantic femininity, always with taste, sensibility and refinement, making the most of her own natural attributes.
