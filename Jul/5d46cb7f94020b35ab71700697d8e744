 The star welcomed baby Rex with long term partner Joe Swash in May; the couple’s first baby together.
And now Stacey has revealed that before the birth, she worried her middle son Leighton, seven, may feel “pushed out”.
But now, the mother has revealed that there is no sibling rivalry between her sons and Leighton loves his baby brother to bits. Posting a sweet snap of Leighton carrying baby Rex, the mum-of-three wrote, “Rex you have no idea how much your brother loves you.
“I definitely worried about Leighton feeling pushed out when I got pregnant with Rex. He’s been the baby of the family for so long and he’s thoroughly enjoyed it. Turns out I had absolutely nothing to worry about!”
Stacey carried on to add that Leighton has “taken the role of big brother in his stride” and had even volunteered to come to work with her to help look after Rex. She went on to express her pride for her son. Adding, “And oh my goodness baby boy (you’ll always be my baby, even when it gets really embarrassing) I couldn’t have had better help. I love you to the moon and back and I know how lucky I am to have you.”
Stacey has been praised over the last few months by fans who are thankful that the Loose Women presenter is sharing a realistic view of motherhood.
