 A spokesperson for his family told ABC News: “It is with a profoundly heavy heart that we report that this morning we lost Cameron. He passed away in his sleep due to a seizure which was a result of an ongoing medical condition for which he was being treated. “The world is now undoubtedly without one of its brightest lights, but his spirit will live on through the kindness and compassion of all who knew and loved him. “We are utterly heartbroken and ask for privacy during this immensely difficult time as we grieve the loss of our precious son and brother.” Boyce made his screen debut in the 2008 supernatural horror film Mirrors. He became famous for his screen role in Jessie as Luke Ross, a part he played alongside Debby Ryan as the eponymous lead character. In a statement released to ABC News, a Disney Channel spokesperson said: “From a young age, Cameron Boyce dreamed of sharing his extraordinary artistic talents with the world. As a young man, he was fueled by a strong desire to make a difference in peoples’ lives through his humanitarian work. “He was an incredibly talented performer, a remarkably caring and thoughtful person and, above all else, he was a loving and dedicated son, brother, grandson and friend. “We offer our deepest condolences to his family, castmates and colleagues and join his many millions of fans in grieving his untimely passing. He will be dearly missed.” The post Disney Star Cameron Boyce Has Died At Age 20  Source: Independent
