 While some social media users are enjoying the ‘bedmatics’ sessions between BBNaija housemates Khafi and Gedoni, some others are showing concern that she is falling for the wrong person especially because he doesn’t really like her so much. Just recently, Toke shared her opinion on Khafi’s relationship and opined that the police officer needs to see a counselor as she seems to have unresolved issues of wanting to be accepted and that is making her give the wrong guy all her love and attention. Toke stated that she caught up with Khafi during her diary session and she needs to focus on her game and leave Gedoni who appears to be using her.
