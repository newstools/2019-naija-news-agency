Boity Thulo  joined Toke Makinwa , Ayanda Thabethe and Sarah Langa at  Vodacom Durban July 2019 , which was held at the Greyville Racecourse on Saturday (July 6) in Durban, South Africa. The South African rapper and presenter is known for her eclectic personal style, and on this occasion she opted to go for a super glam version of the Boity we know and love. 3D feather embellishments and a heavily beaded trompe l’oeil  bodice add serious textural appeal to her outfit. The royal purple shade coupled with the thigh high slit give Boity’s look an extra dose of high octane glamour. Metallic silver star sandals, minimal jewelry and marcelled  hairstyle completed this look.
