 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed at their meeting on Sunday to push forward dialog for making a new breakthrough in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, North Korean state media said. Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea on Sunday when he met Kim in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas and agreed to resume stalled nuclear talks according to globalnews.ca. “The top leaders of the two countries agreed to keep in close touch in the future, too, and resume and push forward productive dialogs for making a new breakthrough in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and in the bilateral relations,” KCNA news agency said. The meeting, initiated by a tweet by Trump that Kim said took him by surprise, displayed the rapport between the two, but analysts said they were no closer to narrowing the gap between their positions since they walked away from their summit in February in Vietnam. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters shortly before departing South Korea that a new round of talks would likely happen “sometime in July” and the North’s negotiators would be foreign ministry diplomats.
