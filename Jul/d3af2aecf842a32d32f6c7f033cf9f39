 Kyle Walker believes Manchester City now owe it to themselves to win the Champions League. The full-back sees it as the club’s next challenge after sweeping almost all before them to win five trophies over the past two seasons, including back-to-back Premier League titles according to itv.com. “I’ve said before that for City to be where they want to be, I think they need to win the Champions League,” he said. “I think we need to win the Champions League, us as players. I think some of the players in the dressing room have achieved too much in their careers and done too much for football not to win the Champions League. So, we owe it to them and ourselves.” Walker has joined City during a period of remarkable success, having arrived from Tottenham in a £45million deal in 2017. With City showing no signs of letting up and spending a club record £62.8million on midfielder Rodri over the summer, Walker is confident more trophies will follow. The 29-year-old said: “It’s been great since I moved two years ago. I’ve achieved things I didn’t think I’d achieve in football. “To win not one but two Premier League titles has been fantastic and the records we have achieved, making us one of the great Premier League teams of all time – I don’t think I would have achieved that if I wasn’t with City. “The first year was phenomenal and nobody thought that could be bettered, but we topped that. So hopefully this year we can do something special. “It’s going to come with a lot of challenges and a lot of surprises but I feel as a team we have got the experience now to go and achieve what we want to.” The post Walker Urges Man City To Step Up  Source: Independent
