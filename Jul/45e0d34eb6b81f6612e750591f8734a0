 Yoruba actress Nkechi Blessing faced serious backlash from an auto dealer that called her out after she claimed she just bought a Mercedes Benz. A family member of the car dealer called out the actress saying their attention was drawn to the photo of the car Nkechi claimed to be hers. The person also accused Nkechi that: “Just because you know my uncle is not on Instagram that’s why you did this forgetting Instagram is a small community. Although I learnt you begged already and taken down the picture but still it is wrong to mislead people” Nkechi later took down the picture of the Benz she uploaded earlier after the real owner called her out, she then upload another one to congratulate herself. It seems the actress had bought something similar but the picture she uploaded earlier was gotten from the page of dealer.
