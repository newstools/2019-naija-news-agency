 Kizz Daniel has denied reports that he weighed in on the trending matter between Busola Dakolo and COZA founder, Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo. Reports by some media houses have been circulating online that says Kizz Daniel considered Wizkid to be the only artiste with “brain” in the music industry for refusing to comment on the Busola VS Pastor Fatoyinbo rape allegation saga. The reports have it that Kizz Daniel called other artistes brainless because they jumped quickly on the rape allegation matter whereas Wizkid got withdrawn. Kizz Daniel has however moved to quickly deny the reports he made such a precarious move as he curses the pioneers of story. He took to his Instagram page to quickly frown at the report. He wrote, “God will punish you both now and in eternity @iamkyno — you and all the people behind you. I’m coming for you with all I’ve got Oga and I swear, you go feel am. “My attention has been drawn to a publication by the Vanguard newspaper stating that I took sides with the embattled Pastor of COZA , Abidoudn Fatoyinbo. “I will like to categorically state that I never granted any interview with vanguard or any newspaper. I am currently busy on tour in the US and haven’t had the time to discuss the issue in my closet let alone call industry mates names. “Please disregard this news article making rounds. It is false and fabricated, I have not spoken to any journalist regarding the said matter or any other matter including music in recent times. . “Any platform(s) that publishes this news or any unverified news about Kizz Daniel and FlyBoy INC. will face legal action “And as for you @iamkyno pls run away as far as you can, I beg you  @vanguardnews bastards!!!! @iamtimiblaq ti e ma baje patapata ni awsr.” God will punish you both now and in eternity @iamkyno — you and all the people behind you.
