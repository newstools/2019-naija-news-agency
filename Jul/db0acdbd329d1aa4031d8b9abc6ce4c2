We did not immediately understand what happened. At first, we thought that they were drifting, but then we realized that they were captured,” Sedler said. He said that 15 Russians and two citizens of South Korea were on board of a fishing vessel. The vessel was escorted to the port of Wonsan in North Korea, 14 sailors are kept on the boat. They are searched and interrogated. The captain, his assistant, and two South Korean crew members are also detained and are held in a hotel.
