Political analyst, Reno Omokri has debunked a comment of ‘sleeping when Yorubas are beating the drums of war’ credited to Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, as he revealed how two Yoruba men; Benjamin Adekunle and Olusegun Obsanjo won the Biafran war for Nigeria.
Alleging that Nigerians never learn from history, the former Presidential spokesperson recalled how Murtala Mohammed suffered defeat at the hands of Biafrans at Abagana, losing almost 4,000 soldiers and had to be airlifted by a helicopter.
