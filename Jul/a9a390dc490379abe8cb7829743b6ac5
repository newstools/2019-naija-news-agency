Iran has summoned the British ambassador in Tehran over the “illegal seizure” of an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar, Iranian state TV quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying. British Royal Marines detained an oil tanker in Gibraltar suspected of carrying oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions on Thursday – a dramatic step that could escalate confrontation between the West and Iran. Iran claimed the seizure by Britain was “destructive” and could increase tensions in the Gulf. The government in the British overseas territory said port and law enforcement agencies, assisted by the Royal Marines, boarded the Grace 1 supertanker on Thursday. Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar’s chief minister, said in a statement: “We have detained the vessel and its cargo. This action arose from information giving the Gibraltar government reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel, the Grace 1, was acting in breach of EU sanctions against Syria. “We have reason to believe that the Grace 1 was carrying its shipment of crude oil to the Banyas refinery in Syria.” he EU imposed sanctions on the country in 2011 after Bashar al-Assad‘scrackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators spiralled into civil war. Prime minister Theresa May’s official spokesperson said: “We welcome this firm action to enforce EU sanctions against the Syrian regime and commend the Gibraltarian authorities involved in successfully carrying out this morning’s operation. “This sends a clear message that violation of the sanctions is unacceptable.” The Foreign Office also welcomed the “firm action” by the Gibraltarian authorities.
