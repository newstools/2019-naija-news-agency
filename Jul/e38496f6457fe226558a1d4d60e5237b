 Manchester United are preparing to keep Alexis Sanchez beyond the transfer window amid a lack of buyers for the Chilean. Sanchez, 30, has performed pitifully for the majority of his 18-month United career and scored only twice last season but is contracted to the club until 2022 according to manchestereveningnews.co.uk.  Chile international Sanchez scored two in the recent Copa America, as well as the decisive spotkick in the penalty shootout win over Colombia. Chile coach Reinaldo Rueda claimed Sanchez performs better for club than country since he ‘does not have the emotional bond’ with his United teammates. Sanchez suffered a hamstring injury in Chile’s third-place play-off win over Argentina and the former Arsenal forward started just 19 times last season for United. The club have been open to selling Sanchez but his club-record wages have proved prohibitive and Solskjaer is preparing to have him available for United’s final pre-season friendlies against Kristansund on July 30 and AC Milan on August 3. “I don’t think Alexis’s injury was too bad. When he’s due back – three weeks after the last game – so when we come back from the tour he’s due back. “I would expect him to be fit enough to play straight away and train straight away.” Left winger Daniel James has arrived to further marginalise Sanchez but, whilst discussing United’s need to sharpen their attack, Solskjaer explained: “We had four players in double figures [last season]. Of course that’s great, we don’t rely on one to score 30 or 40 goals. “But of course  we’ve got Anthony [Martial], Rom [Lukaku], Marcus [Rashford], you’ve got Alexis chipping in more, Mason [Greenwood]’s due a breakthrough, I think Dan James is going to chip in with goals. “And the more players you get in double figures, great.” The post Manchester United Drop Alexis Sanchez Transfer Hint  Source: Independent
