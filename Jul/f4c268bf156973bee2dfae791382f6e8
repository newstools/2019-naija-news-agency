 Slum Art foundation has commenced the building of the physical structure of its school for arts using plastic bottles. The project which is officially named as the Slum Art “Pet Bottle” school will be an Educational Monument for children living within the slum in ijora badia in Lagos state with the aim of empowering the children with a conducive facility to be trained with the skills of Art. The foundation whose sole focus has been to empower Children living within various slums in Lagos state through mentorship, restructuring of mindset and to help them build their creative talent and skills in making them useful to themselves and their immediate community. Speaking about the building project, Director, Slum Art Foundation and four-time Guinness World Record holder, Adetunwase Adenle stated that, the drive for building of the facility is one aimed at providing children with an enabling environment within the slum, where children can be free and stay within a secured environment after school learning required skills in Art. He further stated that, “the use of plastic bottles in the construction of the school is one aimed at showcasing the usefulness of artistic materials around us through disposed and discarded materials termed as “waste” lying around in our society.” Adetunwase further stated that, the children in the slum have been made to understand the impact of the waste, especially the plastic materials around their community which leads to flooding and have become integral parts in the building process of the school as they have been key drivers in cleaning their environments through picking of plastic bottles which have been included in the depository towards the completion of the school. “Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwolu, recently urged industrial organizations on the need to develop alternatives to plastic bottles and other non-degradable items constituting major threats to the sustainability of our environment, through the pilot project of the School construction in Ijora Badia Slum by Slum Art, we hope to be a part of the drive by the current administration in sustaining a healthy environment whilst also creating an enabling set-up that takes children off the streets after school and imparting them with required skill-sets that will aid their development” he concluded.
