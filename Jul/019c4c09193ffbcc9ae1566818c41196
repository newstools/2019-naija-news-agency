 Flashlights were up everywhere in Abuja as Zlatan Ibile climbs the stage to deliver his music performance as usual. Zlatan Ibile has so much going for him; a successful career as a rapper and dancehall singer and a loyal fan base. Zlatan Ibile used to be a “just there” singer that was hungry for fame but all of that changed on Oct 2017, when he released a song- “My body” with Olamide. Now he sees so much flashing lights when he performs on stage and he can’t be less proud of himself.
