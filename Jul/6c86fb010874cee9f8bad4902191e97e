 Rihanna is once again using her platform to draw attention to the crisis in Sudan and the plight of the people who are demanding for a civilian rule. Throughout last month, the singer cum entrepreneur ensured that her voice was not silent or lost. She shared an image on her Instagram Stories where she highlighted many of the issues faced in the country, following the military clampdown.  Over the weekend, Rihanna also posted on Instagram, sharing her concern and sending love and prayers to the people of Sudan. She shared: ‘With more protests planned for today, June 30, I send my ❤️ and I pray for the safety of the Sudanese people. They have a right to speak out and demand peace, justice, and a transition to civilian rule.
Over 100 were killed and hundreds more were wounded during the June 3rd protests. Military rulers need to be held accountable. Praying for no more killings or abuse today. Fight for human rights in #Africa and stand with protesters in #Sudan.
