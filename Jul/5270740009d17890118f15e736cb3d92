South African Rapper, AKA, took to his Twitter after the match between South Africa and Nigeria last night ended in 2-1, favouring Nigeria to make some comments Nigerians did not like. AKA said “We should have just lost to Egypt … rather than Nigeria.” Nigerians came after him for that comment and they did not hesitate in bringing the xenophobic attacks in South Africa into the banter. He has been facing backlash for the comment all day. The most prolific of all comments being that the “Super Eagles of Nigeria beat the Xenophobia out of Bafana Bafana of South Africa”. Nigerians have not taken the comment funny, and here are some of the toughest comebacks: Look at this banana banana pic.twitter.com/KUwNw23oC0 — EUPH😂RIA (@s0tonye) July 10, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Don’t worry bro, Davido will console you with a feature🤣🤣🤣 — BREZZADDICT💉 (@waxzyyy) July 10, 2019  So painful, super Eagles beat xenophobic out of yall pic.twitter.com/A2KV4y8uIA — Tokan (@futurKing) July 10, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Egypt let you pass on purpose so we can beat xenophobia out of you pple.#NoToXenophobia — Atiku's Boy.

While some of these tweets are hilarious, others are just MEAN. In the end, we proud of the Super Eagles for winning the match against South Africa.
