Chude Jideonwo was a guest on TVC breakfast show, Your View on Tuesday, 16 July, 2019 to discuss the rape allegations against COZA pastor, Biodun Fatoyinbo by photographer, Busola Dakolo. Speaking on the issue, Chude, who interviewed Busola, said other survivors have stepped out to share their sexual abuse stories allegedly involving Fatoyinbo. “The team has met and listened to five survivors who have shared their sexual assault experiences with Fatoyinbo. We are not releasing the interviews because the survivors only did these interviews because they wanted to help. So this is really about seeking justice and healing for the survivors,” Chude said. Chude also revealed that Busola had made a formal police report before the viral interview was published and that submission contains all the details of their encounter.
