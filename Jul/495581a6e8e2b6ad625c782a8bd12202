 Senator Elisha Abbo, who was caught on camera assaulting a woman, appeared before a Senate committee set up to investigate the incident on Tuesday afternoon, July 9. According to Premium Times, the Adamawa lawmaker, however, refused to speak in front of newsmen or take an oath before the panel. It was gathered that before being allowed to testify, individuals invited before Senate committees are made to take oaths to pledge to say the truth. Abbo reportedly insisted that he would address the panel before taking the oath; a decision that led to an exchange of words with members of the committee. A committee member, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, had asked Abbo to swear an oath before saying anything. He bluntly refused, saying the matter was in court. He said: “This matter is in court. I cannot be talking in front of cameras when the matter is already in court. That’s subjudice.” Tinubu then responded: “Distinguished, you just joined us. We have a procedure and we are also under law. You don’t come in here and dictate to us what should be done. “You are on the other side now. You don’t tell us what to do…because we can suspend you.” Following the female lawmaker’s comment, an angry Abbo promptly interjected: “I will not sit here and listen to you threaten me with suspension. I am a senator like you. You cannot threaten me with suspension.” The chaos reportedly lasted for some minutes and newsmen were subsequently asked to leave in order for the meeting to continue behind closed doors.
