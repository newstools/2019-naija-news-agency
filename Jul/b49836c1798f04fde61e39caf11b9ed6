 Crystal Palace have had a big-money bid for Chelsea youngster Reece James rejected, The Daily Star reports. The Eagles are desperate to find a replacement for Aaron Wan-Bissaka and have a significant transfer budget to spend owing to the fee received for their former academy prospect. James has reportedly urged as a top target for the South London outfit, with the club allegedly tabling an offer of £20m for the Blues youngster. The 19-year-old spent last season on loan at Wigan and cleaned up at the Latics end of season awards following an excellent campaign in the Championship. As such Chelsea are reluctant to sell the hot prospect on a permanent transfer, with new boss Frank Lampard unable to make any signings as things stand due to a transfer ban imposed on the club. James’ versatility, having played at both right-back and central midfield to great effect last season, is still something his current club may value over the coming season.
