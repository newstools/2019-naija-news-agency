   @sevondejana The dress, a long sleeved black dress with mesh detail on both sleeves, ends just above knees and features plunging neckline which comes with a choker. Perfect for a date night where you want to be all dressed up and extra or a fun night out with the girls!  @sharonooja Sharon, ever a BellaStylista, wore the dress in an absolutely fashionable way. Pairing it with a box purse, a pair of black strappy bedazzled sandals and simple accessories. She also had her hair in a low pony tail and her face was appropriately beat to fit the occasion!
