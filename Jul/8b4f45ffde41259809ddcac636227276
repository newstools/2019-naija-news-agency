 VIDEO: Ian Jazzi ft. Efya – Ankhasa  Ghanaian/Nigerian rapper Ian Jazzi presents a brand new single featuring Ghanaian soul singer Efya. The song is titled “Ankhasa”. AnkhAsa (“”ankasa” spelt on purpose to include ankh) is an Akan word used by Ghanaians, which translates as “indeed”, so when you tell someone you be my baby ankhasa, what you’re saying is, “You’re indeed my baby for life”.
