 This video has been flying all around social media, but just a part of it, anyway. Singer Reekado Banks was on Pop Central TV when someone called in to speak with him. Giving her name as Cindy, the called proceeded to ask Reekado why he had sex with her and refused to call her back. She said she’s been sending him a message but no response. She continued: “Please see, Reekado Banks, the only way I will stop disturbing you is if you tell me that you love me back because I said that to you after sex and you didn’t say anything.” Reekado then went on to tell her he loves her too. The she goes: “That’s fine. Please check you Instagram, it’s really not nice.” That’s when the singer realised he’s been pranked. LOL.
