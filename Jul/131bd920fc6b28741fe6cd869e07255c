I think one of the most important things in the music scene is collaborations. If you look at the latest Naija music collaborations you’ll understand that collaborations play a major role in music. Having two or more artists combine forces on a track might be what is required to birth the best track for a particular season or a whole music year. The latest Naija music collaborations have been interesting, to say the least. We have seen artists from different genres come together and the outcomes have been heavenly save for a few. Notjustok have taken a careful consideration of recent collaborations and have decided to string together a list of some of the best collabos. Mayorkun and Kizz Daniel are some of the hottest Afropop artists. Their chemistry on this banger True is palpable as you listen to the two singers massacring the song. Skiibii is making himself a hub of bangers. After the success of Sensima (featuring Reekado Banks), he seeks the expertise of Falz, Teni, and DJ Neptune on this critically-acclaimed single Daz How Star Do. Kizz Daniel and Tiwa Savage on a song with Young Jonn as the producer? Hook it to my veins. Ello Baby is an absolute jam. The two singers dco justice to well-prepared Young Jonn instrumental. So far, I think this has been the most anticipated collaboration. The anticipation for the song has been wild and it’s safe to say that Olamide and Wizkid came through on the ID Cabasa jam Totori. This is one of my favorite Naija collaborations of the year. We all know that Falz is a beast and Dice Ailes delivers a mouth-watering hook to give Alakori the spice it requires. Niniola and Reminisce met up to collaborate on the Sarz-produced instrumental and the single they churned out (Jensimi) is scintillating.
