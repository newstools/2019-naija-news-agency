Gokada followed suit and the likes of safe Boda, Opay, etc. launched afterward. The startups have been a major player in helping Lagos residents evade traffic. The companies had smooth rides in Lagos state till recently when the Lagos State Transport Union of workers started demanding a ticket fee five times higher than the regular N100 ticket fee from the startups. Lagos is definitely not ready for business.

Lagos prides itself as a self-sufficient state, recording a $3.1 billion Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) in 2015. It has been alleged that the state government is jumping on the booming motorcycle ride-hailing sector to secure a significant revenue for the state. We are not yet sure if this is true, but time will tell. The startups operating in Lagos State have been able to raise significant amounts recently. Max.ng raised $7 million, Gokada raised $5.3 million and the newly launched Oride raised $40million. They all raised these funds to boost expansion, which we are not sure of, considering the recent controversies. The major concern now, however, is that this recent development might scare away competitors. The alleged amount could also scare away potential investors in the State‚Äôs transport sector when confirmed. We will keep you updated soon.
