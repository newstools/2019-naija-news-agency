 One of the biggest transfer sagas of the summer has been the potential departure of Kieran Tierney from Scottish football, According to Footballscotland.co.uk. The Celtic left-back is being targeted by both Arsenal and Napoli, but so far there has been no deal struck to sign him. Manager Neil Lennon has confirmed there has been an offer for Tierney, but made clear that Celtic won’t budge on their valuation of one of their star talents. Given that he’s played for Scotland and in the Champions League it’s understandable that Tierney’s club expect a big fee for him, but is their asking price too high? The left-back spent much of last season battling an injury problem, which required surgery over the summer. On the other hand, some would say that £25m is too low a valuation, given that Aaron Wan Bissaka moved to Manchester United for £50m after only 46 appearances for Crystal Palace and no international caps.
