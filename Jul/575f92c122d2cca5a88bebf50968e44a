 There is no doubt that Naira Marley is fast garnering fans both within and outside the country. Today, his fan base cut across the street where he is from and a few elite. With his increase in fan base, is a growing concern about his influence. The title of his songs namely ‘Opotoyi,’ ‘Ko Si Werey,’ ‘Illuminati,’ ‘Soapy’ and ‘Am I A Yahoo Boy’ tells fans and critics the artiste’s mindset and what to expect from him musically. But more worrisome is his silent portrayal of drug abuse as a norm. Almost every video of the singer has him smoking weed. The act is now synonymous with him such that it is his opening when shooting his videos. From the video of ‘Japa,’ ‘Opotoyi’ to ‘Am I A Yahoo Boy,’ the silent endorsement of drug abuse is evident and strong without fear for regulatory bodies or the fact that he might be misleading his young fans. While his fans might want to scream hypocrite, as usual, the need for the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), and the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission NBC), to put a check on the visuals of the artiste is important. If songs like Falz’s ‘This Is Nigeria’ which shed light on the ills ravaging the country could be banned, why then is ‘Soapy’ and ‘Opotoyi’ still enjoying airplay? In the past, songs such as ‘If ’ remix by Davido, ‘Living Things’ by 9ice and ‘Wavi Level’ by Olamide have all received the hammer for their questionable lyrics. ‘Opotoyi’ and ‘Soapy’ shouldn’t be an exception.
