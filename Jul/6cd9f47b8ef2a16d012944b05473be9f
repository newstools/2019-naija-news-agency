 Ese Walter has reacted to a viral video of Funke Akindele where she stated clearly that her friends are disallowed to call her husband, JJC Skillz. Ese Walter in a clear manner, supports Funke Akindele’s standpoint and she narrated how a friend called her ex-husband when they were still married to tell him something she told her in confidence and how her husband reacted. She wrote: Watched a video of Funke (Jenifa) saying her friend shouldn’t call her husband and it reminded me of that time my friend called my then husband. Said friend and I had a misunderstanding and her way of getting back to me was to call him and tell him things I had told her when we (me and him) had a fight. His phone rings (we were watching GOT that day) He pick up then paused the dvd. “Hello.” “Hello, I am *******, Ese’s friend.” “Ok? Do you want to speak with her?” “No. I want to talk to you. I need to tell you some of the things she said about you to me.” “Wait, you want to tell me some of the things my wife said to you, her friend, about me?” “Yes. And…” “First of all, how did you get my number? Second, if she said them to you, why do you think you can just call me to tell me? If she wanted to tell me, she is right here and will tell me herself.” Silence. “Please don’t call this line again.” He hung up then told me about the conversation, adding “When I tell you those internet girls are not your friends, you will say they are nice and they like you. Just see this clown calling my phone to tell me what?” Now it’s me who was silent. He kuku press play on the GOT we were watching. Me to myself – Girls are scum ?
