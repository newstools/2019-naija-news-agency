But knowing he’d be so irritated with the way I was carrying on, lol (he’d taught me to always stay strong, no matter the situation) I’d decided to deal with the loss by reconnecting with him the best way I knew how.. And hoped if he could see this, he’d be proud. #wunmiobeart #pencildrawing #pencilart #pencilartwork #pencilartist #family #brother #blood #Wayne A post shared by  Wunmi Tunde-Obe (@wunmiobeart) on Jul 21, 2019 at 7:16am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Tunde Obe   Celebrating the "Mr."❤ #WunmiObeArt #Pencilart #pencildrawing #pencilartwork A post shared by  Wunmi Tunde-Obe (@wunmiobeart) on Jul 22, 2019 at 3:38pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js Fela, Femi and Made Kuti   Afrobeat Generation Next.
