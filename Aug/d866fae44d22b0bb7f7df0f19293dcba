 Lagos – The Federal Government has been called upon to see the ongoing #RevolutionNow protest as a wake-up call from Nigerians who are undergoing untold hardship, asking government for protection of their lives and properties. Reacting to the ongoing agitation for better lives for Nigerians, the Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Most Rev Dr Alfred Adewale Martins, in a release made public by the Acting Director of Social Communications, Rev Fr Anthony Godonu, said that the Buhari-led government should see the agitation as an opportunity to directly hear the complaints of Nigerians and redouble their efforts towards fulfilling their constitutional role of securing the lives and properties of the people. Archbishop Martins, while expressing his displeasure over the rising cases of insecurity across the country, particularly the kidnapping and killing of innocent Nigerians by armed bandits, warned that except urgent and concrete measures were taken to reassure Nigerians of the safety of their lives and properties across the country, things might soon get out of hand. People, he said, may be forced to resort to self-help if the government and the security agencies continue to fail them.
