If you had a crush on superstar actor Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, I have bad news for you, he is now married and off the market. He recently married his long-time girlfriend and mother of two of his kids, Lauren Hashian in a secret wedding in Hawaii. The 47-year-old former wrestler announced on his Instagram earlier today that the couple had taken the plunge and gotten married. He said, “We do. August 18th, 2019. Hawaii. Pōmaikaʻi (blessed). @laurenhashianofficial❤️” The couple both dressed in simple attires perfect for the waterfront where they got hitched. The bride looked amazing in a white flowery and lace dress with her hair in beach waves under a long veil. The Rock, on the other hand, wore a white shirt and trouser with nice black shoes. The couple has been receiving congratulatory messages from all of their celebrity friends since The Rock posted very romantic pictures and made the announcement on his Instagram. One of his friends and co-star from Jumanji, Kevin Hart sent him a simple “congrats man!”. The Rock and Lauren Hashian had been together for 12 years since they started dating in 2007. They have two kids together – their first daughter, Jasmine, was born in 2015. They had their second daughter, Tiana in April 2018. Before the birth of Tiana, they had already planned to get married but had to push back the wedding because of the pregnancy. Dwayne also has an eighteen years old daughter, Simone, who he fondly calls SGJ, from his previous marriage with a professional bodybuilder, Dany Garcia. Anyway, congratulations to Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and his beautiful wife. The post Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Secretly Marries Longtime Heartthrob appeared first on Nigerian Entertainment Today.
