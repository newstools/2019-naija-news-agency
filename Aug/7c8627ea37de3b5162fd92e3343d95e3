 37-year-old Pop star turned leading opposition figure Bobi Wine, has been charged with intending to “annoy, alarm or ridicule” Uganda’s President, Yoweri Museveni, according to BBC. Bobi wine whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, appeared in court on a previous treason charge after him and other opposition politicians allegedly stoned Museveni’s convoy during a campaign rally in August 2018. The new charge is also as a result of the same incident. He has also been charged with inciting violence after being accused of calling on his supporters to physically harm the president. “This government of President Museveni is in panic mode. At first, it was treason and now it is annoying President Museveni. Who on earth can’t be annoyed?” Wine told AFP. “It is a ridiculous charge and I am ready to challenge it in court,” he said.
