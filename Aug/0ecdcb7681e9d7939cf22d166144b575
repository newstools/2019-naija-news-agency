A new BBC News Pidgin video follows the story of Amida, a 5 year old born with a rare genetic skin condition called Lamellar Ichthyosis. Lamella ichthyosis causes the skin to flake and adopt a scale-like look. Amida has stopped attending school due to constant bullying, and her mum, a hairdresser, has lost customers because of her daughter’s condition. A patient really needs support and proper care of the skin, says dermatologist Ayesha Akinkugbe, and Amida’s mum has proven to be a great support system.
