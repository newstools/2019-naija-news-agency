 Big Brother Naija housemate, Joe was having a discussion about controversial female, Tacha. “For the fact that she hit me will make me do it again and again and i am going to piss her off so much until she realizes that i am not like everybody else…. He stated before dropping the bombshell about Tacha’s low IQ.  Her eyelashes are higher than her IQ……” This brought an immediate reaction from Omashola and Ike who heard him say that and they were both shocked and embarrassed on behalf of Tacha. However on Sunday, Joe, when asked about his behaviour in the House, admitted to using sarcasm as a good strategy for him in the game. We can’t wait to see how well this plays out for him.
