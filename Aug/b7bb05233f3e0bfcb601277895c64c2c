 Oil prices crashed further yesterday to extend sharp overnight losses as Unite States crude inventories unexpectedly rose, as fears of recession mounted and economic data out of China and Europe disappointed. Brent crude was down 39 cents, or 0.7 per cent, at $59.09 a barrel after falling 3 per cent in the last session. Also, the U.S. crude was down 28 cents, or 0.5 per cent, at $54.95 a barrel, having dropped 3.3 per cent in the previous session.
