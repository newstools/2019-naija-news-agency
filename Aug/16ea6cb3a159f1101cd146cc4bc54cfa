 Thousands have gathered in Moscow to demand free elections despite a
police crackdown, according to Presstv.com reports. It is the fourth consecutive week when large numbers of people have
taken to the streets of the Russian capital to demand
opposition-minded candidates be allowed to run in a Moscow election
next month – something the authorities have so far refused to allow. Saturday’s protest has been authorized by city authorities, but a
similar protest a week earlier was not and police detained more than
1,000 people. The post Tens Of Thousands Rally In Moscow In Support Of Free Elections  Source: Independent
