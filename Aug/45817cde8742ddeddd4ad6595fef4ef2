 LAGOS – Professor Motunrayo Olumakaiye, wife of Rt. Rev Humphrey Olumakaiye, Diocesan Bishop Church of Nigeria, Anglican Church, has charged women to deepen their walks with God to enable them make progress in all aspects of life. The president of the Women’s and Girls’ Organisations, in her address at this year’s Centenary Women’s Conference, themed; ‘Stronger, Deeper and Higher’, said it was imperative that women walked closely with God to avoid eternal regrets. “As Christians we need to make progress in our walk and work with the Lord. If you have been in a particular spiritual level for too long, it is time to move on to deeper, higher and stronger relationship with the Lord; it is time to move on to spiritual progress and maturity. “God is never happy seeing you operating at the same level of spirituality; He wants you to grow bigger and deeper. “It is important to emphasise that without stronger, deeper and higher relationship with the Lord, we will be terribly disappointed in eternity,” she stated. She made known that a deeply-rooted relationship with God couldn’t occur in the absence of re-evaluation of one’s spiritual state and resolution to make necessary changes. On how to achieve spirituality, she suggested, “thirst and desire for higher relationship with God, proper feeding on God’s word, constant prayer life, consecration to God and constant fellowship with God.” The post Bishop’s Wife Charges Women On Relationship With God  Source: Independent
