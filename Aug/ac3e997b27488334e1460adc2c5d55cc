Our very own talented singer, Chidinma returns to the music scene after a long while off duty. She joins forces with gospel singer and producer, Frank Edwards for this powerful worship song titled “Holy” (Mimo! Mimo!). In her words… ‘I remember when i discussed with @frankrichboy about recording a worship song, we literally didn’t know where to start but all he said to me was ‘relax God will give us a song’ , we shared, he started to play the keys and we began to worship! Immediately he said just hold let me record this worship straight up !! And this song was birthed.. I love God and this is me just expressing my love to Him. Thank you @frankrichboy‘. Chidinma worships the Holy one with her magical voice… a touching song of praise straight from the heart. ‘Holy‘ was released in a visual format, Watch, listen and worship the ancient of days, Mighty and Holy one that worthy of Praise.
