 Funke Akindele Bello just keeps breaking grounds and we’re here for it! The “Jenifa’s Diary” creator and star is making her first feature film directorial debut for EbonyLife Films’ “Your Excellency” set for release this December. EbonyLife boss Mo Abudu disclosed this on Instagram on Monday, announcing the beginning of shooting for the movie where Funke is also lead actress. “Your Excellency tells the story of Chief Olalekan Ajadi, a bumbling, billionaire businessman and failed presidential candidate, who is obsessed with Donald Trump. Just when his campaign looks set to be another disaster, Ajadi is anointed by a major party and becomes a credible contender – all through the power of social media,” Abudu said. Written by Yinka Ogun and produced by Isioma Osaje and James Amuta, Your Excellency boasts of a star-studded cast, including Lala Akindoju, Shaffy Bello, Kunle Coker, Eku Edewor, Alexx Ekubo, EmmahohMaGod, Oreka Godis, Osas Ighodalo, Seyi Law, Akin Lewis, Bimbo Manuel, Ini Dima-Okojie, Deyemi Okanlawon, Chioma ‘Chigul’ Omeruah, Ikechukwu Onunaku, Helen Paul, among others.
