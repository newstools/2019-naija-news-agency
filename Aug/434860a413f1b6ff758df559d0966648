 REAL MADRID fans went into meltdown on social media after the club confirmed Eden Hazard will miss their opening game of the season. Real get their La Liga campaign underway at Celta Vigo tomorrow (4pm GMT) but manager Zinedine Zidane will have to make do without summer signing Hazard, who was signed from Chelsea for an initial £88million. A statement from the club that read: “After the tests carried out after training today on our player Eden Hazard by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a muscular injury to the anterior part of his right thigh. “His recovery will continue to be assessed.” Supporters are cursing their luck once again after it was confirmed on Wednesday that new signing Rodrygo had suffered a similar problem and was facing up to three weeks on the sidelines. “Came here for revolution and I finally see revolution,” one wrote. “All the new signings getting injured. Back to Vinicius Benzema Vazquez front 3.” Another simply said: “We are cursed.” A third agreed: “Let’s just cancel this damned season and move to the next one.” Another fan had questions about what the players were doing during pre-season training. “We need some serious review of the training and sport med program,” they wrote. Another said: “Oh no. An injury already. I wish him a speedy recovery!” Real are reportedly still looking to bring in some reinforcements, not only to help with their injury struggles but to add to the squad as a whole. Manchester United star Paul Pogba remains their top target although United are determined to hold on to him. They have also been linked with a stunning move for Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar but Barcelona remain favourites to re-sign their former player.
