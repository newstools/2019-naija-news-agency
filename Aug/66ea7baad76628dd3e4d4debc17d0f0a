 Swae Lee the one half of hip hop duo Rae Sremmurd was widely known for his magical voice on French Montana’s 2017 hit song ‘Unforgettable‘. His smashing touch and imprint on the song was what blew the record and took it to the top three on Billboard Hot 100. Swae Lee has been steady on his grind since the breakthrough and has worked with other A-list artiste in the music industry. Going solo and starting a new journey he releases two lovely songs ‘Won’t Be Late’ and ‘Sextasy‘. “Won’t Be Late” is the record produced by our very own hit maker, Tekno featuring Champagnepapi. The beat is a perfect afro-upbeat infused with the foreign cool pop sound. Drake also made use of our own slang ‘Ikebe & Bakasi’ to replace Ass. #AfricaToTheWorld. Listen!!
