 OWERRI – The Ohanaeze Youth Council (OYC) has told Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State to concentrate on governance for the good of his people and the entire Southeast rather than engaging in unhealthy fight with pro-Biafra groups, especially IPOB. Igboayaka O. Igboayaka, the National President of OYC, gave the charge while addressing newsman in Owerri after the OYC national stakeholders congress which included members from Abia, Imo, Enugu, Anambra, Ebonyi, Rivers, Cross Rivers, Akwaibom, Beyelsa, Delta, Edo, Benue and Kogi The Ohanaeze youth leader made the call against the backdrop of the recent pronouncement by the Ebonyi State Government, banning the activities of IPOB, whose members recently protested against the proposed Ruga settlement in the state. Igboayaka noted that rather than continue to add voice to some mischievous elements in the north calling for extreme measures against the pro-Biafra group, Governor Umahi should be advocating for the delisting and de-proscription of IPOB as a terrorist organisation. The youth leader further regretted that none of the northern elites, leaders and governors had come out publicly to condemn the rampaging Fulani herdsmen marauding and maiming innocent citizens in some parts of the country neither have they spoken out in condemnation of the nefarious activities of bandits and other terrorist groups maiming innocent citizens, asking Umahi to be cautious not to throw away the baby with the bath water.
