 Media personality, Toke Makinwa recently shared a post saying she needs to go on a vacation with her female friends as she turns 35 in a few months, adding that it’s her last year single and she’s ready to give marriage a second chance. She laughed at everyone who took the “#LastYearSingle” ‘personal’ and had more to say to the marriage situation on Twitter. The way people are taking the #LastyearSingle hashtag personal is making me laugh 😆 — Toke Makinwa (@tokstarr) August 7, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js First, I am still single, as single as a dollar bill but not as a result of the scarcity of “men”, but by choice. I love me too much to share me with anyone till…. well till I find someone who is worth it. — Toke Makinwa (@tokstarr) August 7, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Second, I am not anti-marriage, I love the institution, the greatest love story I have ever heard of or seen was my folks, they loved and joked about dying together and they were buried side by side. I am a lover girl, just won’t tolerate the BS. 😂 — Toke Makinwa (@tokstarr) August 7, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js If tolerating BS is what you guys call happy – marriage, pls count me out. I am not afraid of being alone, If I give it another chance and I am unhappy I will leave again. Call me crazy or whatever but I am not your average and I will always choose me first. — Toke Makinwa (@tokstarr) August 7, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Speak it to existence love ❤️ https://t.co/MTquQrNEqk — Toke Makinwa (@tokstarr) August 7, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The post “First, I am still single” – Toke Makinwa Clears the Air on #LastYearSingle Post appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
