Once, twice, thrice and the Housemates keep getting hit by Biggie’s shocking twists. In case you missed it, Cindy is the fifth new Housemate to be introduced into the Pepper Dem House this week. With her arrival, came a mix of reactions from the other Housemates in the game. Another spice to the Pepper Dem mix? It just got hotter in here. The Twist Yesterday, before their Thursday Night Presentation, some of the Housemates told Biggie in their Diary Room session that they wished Big Brother would stop bringing in more Housemates. If only they knew what Biggie had waiting for them in the House. Surprise! Oh, the look on their faces when they walked into the House to meet another product of Biggie’s BB Naija Twist. Amidst the warm welcome and shocked looks, one could tell that the Housemates didn’t see it coming. The Housemates weren’t the only ones that got twisted by Biggie’s surprise Biggie and it’s surprises another housemates again.

However, the addition of new Housemates to the game lifted their spirits as it’s been evident from the truth or dare games and the gist aka bonding sessions they’ve had through the week. Eyes On The Prize Amidst the twist, Mercy and Khafi had a conversation about relationships. Mercy in a bid to be helpful told Khafi that even though she loves Gedoni, she should always remember the 60 million Naira at stake in the game. To her, the money stays uppermost in her mind and Khafi should also adopt that mindset. Mercy also told Khafi that Gedoni wants her to blend more with other Housemates and not be too clingy to him. The words have been spoken, let’s see if Khafi will heed them. The Pepper Dem game just got tighter and we can’t wait to see the drama unfold.
