 A teenage boy was impaled by a flying umbrella on a Massachusetts beach, officials said. The 13-year-old boy was seriously injured on Good Harbor Beach in Gloucester, Mass., at 1:40 p.m. Saturday when an umbrella went airborne and hit the boy in the shoulder, according to local fire officials. Beachgoers jumped into action to try and helped treat the teen as they waited for paramedics to arrive, according to WHDH. Gloucester Fire Department Lt. Nick Ouellette told the news outlet, “It’s a pretty rare event around here even with the number of beaches we have, and the amount of people we have visit our beaches every year, it’s not a common occurrence.” The boy was rushed to Beverly Hospital where he was expected to survive, officials said.
