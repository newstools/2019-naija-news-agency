 Ondo State Government on Wednesday assured sustained cordial relationship with workers and labour unions in the state.
The state Head of Service, Mr Dare Aragbaye, gave the assurances at the second quarterly joint negotiating council management meeting in Akure.
The HoS reiterated Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s acknowledgement of the contributions and support of workers to the numerous achievements of his administration in the last two years.
While commending the governor for prioritising welfare of workers within the available scarce resources, the HoS promised that government would not deny workers any of their entitlements.
Aragbaye described civil servants as the engine room of any government in actualising policies and programmes.
He said government would sustain the quarterly meeting to carry the workers along and achieve effective delivery of more dividends of democracy to the people.
Earlier, in a remark, Mr Victor Olajorin, the Permanent Secretary, Department of Establishment and Training, appreciated the HoS for facilitating and personally attending the meeting.
Olajorin said the presence of the HoS at the meeting was a right step towards achieving harmonious government – labour relationship in the state.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports representatives of the various labour unions in the state public service attended the meeting.
NAN also reports that issues bordering on the on-going verification at the local government councils, conversion of workers from one cadre to another, training and other matters relating to public service were discussed.
