Ike Ekweremadu Former deputy senate president, Ike Ekweremadu was attacked by persons said to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Nürnberg, Germany. In the videos, shared by Radio Biafra on Facebook, the attackers are seeing throwing eggs and other items at the senator representing Enugu West. A statement by Nnia Nwodo, President General of Ohanaeze condemned the attack. According to Punch, Nwodo wrote: The assault on Ekweremadu by Igbos in Germany, described as IPOB, is disappointing, grotesque and dangerous for Igbo solidarity. This violent, rude, impertinent, divisive and discourteous style of IPOB or IPOB-instigated miscreants is damaging to our cause. It strengthens the case of those who describe them as terrorists and weaken our case against the infringement of our fundamental human rights. Ekweremadu negotiated the sureties and securities for Nnamdi Kanu’s release on bail. He does not deserve this picketing and disgrace. A disgrace to him is a disgrace to Igbo race. Whilst I condemn the attack on our revered son and leader, I call on the law enforcement agencies in Germany to bring to book the perpetrators of this despicable act. It is un-Igbo. It is disgraceful. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Senior Special Assistant to President Buhari on Diaspora, and the Chairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) also condemned the attack, saying some of the attackers have been arrested. “I condemn in its entirety the attack on former DSP Ike Ekeremadu at an event in Nuremberg . Germany ,nobly put together by Ndi Igbo Germany. where he was attacked. I hope the culprits, some of whom have been arrested, will face consequences for their shamefully pathetic actions,” she wrote on Twitter.
