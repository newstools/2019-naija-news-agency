 Libya is to close three migrant and refugee detention centres after criticism from the UN over squalid conditions and inadequate food supplies. Two of the centres are in the coastal cities of Misrata and Khoms. The third is in Tajura, a suburb of the capital Tripoli. Forces loyal to the warlord Khalifa Haftar hit that facility in an airstrike a month ago, killing at least 52 people.
