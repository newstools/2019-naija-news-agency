 Nigerians on Saturday reacted to the new controversial video released by singer Azeez Fashola, popularly known as Naira Marley, titled “Soapy” whose preview had generated social reactions with many of them negative. The video, shot in a prison cell background, was produced alongside Zanku dance crooner, Zlatan Ibile, Rahman Jago, and Guccy Branch. Naira Marley also said he got the inspiration for the dance while in the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The new dance move, which seems to depict the act of masturbation, was roundly criticised by many Nigerians for its obscene gestures, with Naira Marley having social media spats with award-winning dance expert Khafi Shafau and rapper Rugged Man. Rugged Man was also allegedly attacked by Naira Marley fans in a London restaurant while Naira Marley was being held by the EFCC. It would be recalled that the singer had a recent brush with the EFCC over possible involvement in internet fraud popularly called Yahoo-Yahoo in Nigerian parlance.
