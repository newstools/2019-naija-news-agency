Team Cruisetopia lost the nomination task last night to Team Iconics and were subsequently put up for possible eviction. The nomination tasks are a newly introduced way for Big Brother to determine what housemates will be put up for possible eviction during the Sunday eviction show. The housemates had an interesting nomination challenge yesterday which team Iconics ended up winning. The win must have been a relief for the team as they lost last week and were all put up for possible eviction. The challenge involved all the housemates from both teams and they had to transport coloured water from bowls to stainless cups using a teaspoon. The team with the most filled cup was going to be declared as the winner. Team Iconics had the most filled cups so they were declared the winner while the Cruisetopia team were immediately put up for possible eviction. This meant that Venita, Esther, Seyi, Mike, Mercy, Jackye, Dianne, and Gedoni were supposed to be up for eviction this week. However, Esther is safe from eviction this week as she is the Head of House. Also, Venita was swapped for Frodd by the Veto power holder, Elozonam. So, the list of people now up for possible eviction are Frodd, Seyi, Mike, Mercy, Jackye, Dianne, and Gedoni. Although the task only lasted for five minutes, the after-effects of losing it will probably affect the lives of any of the housemates that are evicted for a long time. As always, we would like to know which of the housemates you think will be evicted during the Sunday eviction show in the comment section below.
