 Former Manchester United midfielder Kleberson is skeptical about Harry Maguire ‘s ability – believing that tougher tests await him. Kleberson has also warned that the 26-year-old will face some ‘tough moments’ in a United shirt because ‘his pace is not the best.’ Maguire was named Man of the Match after United’s 4-0 victory against Chelsea at Old Trafford last Sunday – the perfect way to mark his debut for the club. It was one of the most talked about transfers of the summer and United finally got the deal over the line when they coughed up £80million to lure the England international from Leicester City. Naturally, there is always pressure that comes with a hefty price tag and Kleberson believes that Maguire’s mobility might be a problem this season, according to the Manchester Evening News . The Brazilian said: “Harry Maguire is a big name for any English club. In the World Cup he did a good job, but he’s going to have a few tough moments in one on one’s and his pace is not the best. “I don’t know if he will manage to cover on his own like at times against Chelsea. Maguire has moved for a lot of money but I think the defenders aren’t as good in the league as they were a few years ago, therefore teams need to pay more. “With Maguire and [Victor] Lindelof , I don’t know if [Chris] Smalling and [Phil] Jones need to leave but of course their opportunities to play will be a bit less. Especially as the new defenders have played very well in their first opportunity.” Ole Gunnar Solskjaer takes United to Wolves on Monday night with both sides emerging from the opening weekend of the season with points on the board. Nuno Espirito Santo ‘s side will provide a stern test for the Red Devils who will be looking to build on their purposeful start to the campaign.
