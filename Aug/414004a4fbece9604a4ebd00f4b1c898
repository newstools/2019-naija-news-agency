 Ngozi Uma, Chinyere Abiaziem Openness in marriage cannot be over emphasised because it breeds trust and confidence in a union. Incidentally, the things that make couples to shy away from transparency in their lives are the same things that destroy their marriages. Pastor Wale Afelumo, Senior Pastor of Inspiration Life Community Church, in his piece, SECRETS OF HAPPILY MARRIED COUPLES: OPENNESS & SINCERITY, said openness “is honesty, in practical terms; sincerity is saying the truth whenever you are asked for it but openness is the practice of saying the truth without even being asked for it.” He said further: “Many couples live together physically but are in reality walled off from one another in water-tight compartments. These compartments are full of secret actions, secret plans and secret thoughts that they hide from each other.” Afelumo, in the piece, advised couples on how to encourage their spouses to be open to them; he said, “Commit to trust your spouse unconditionally, stop doing things that give room for suspicion, let your spouse know that whatever they share with you stays with you and give your spouse access to your passwords constantly, sow openness and sincerity and you will get it back.” A branch manager in one of the new generation banks told SUNDAY INDEPENDENT an incident that happened in his branch. He said a man opened savings account for his two kids and refused to make his wife signatory to the accounts; unfortunately, the man died. “I did not know about the death of the man until after a year and it took time before I could reach his wife; by then the children have stopped school because they have to leave Lagos to stay with a relative in Port Harcourt. “Meanwhile, there was huge money left by the man for his children that could take care of their studies to any level. Personally, I don’t see any reason one should hide such things from one’s spouse because at the end of the day, the reasons for saving such money might become futile,” he said. However, many have observed that reasons most couples don’t open up to each other is because of fear of future abuse. They said in a case where the spouse spends extravagantly or is not trustworthy; disclosing amount in the account and any valuables to such spouse is tantamount to bankruptcy. Pastor Victor Akintunde said God’s idea of marriage is for two people to come together and become one. It is not in the contemplation of God that there will be any secret that a man and his wife cannot share with each other. “In Genesis chapter 2 verse 25, the Bible states: ‘and they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.’ for emphasis, nakedness is a man’s or woman’s most prized secret. One that even God helped man to cover properly from others. It is one thing that a man or woman, once they attain adulthood, can no longer share with anyone of the opposite gender including parents. But this prized secret (nakedness) they still share with their spouse and they are not ashamed. “This presupposes that there should not be anything too confidential to a married person that he or she would not be able to share with his or her spouse. So God’s idea of marriage requires total openness. The moment you allow secrets, you create room for trust to be broken,” he said. Rev. Obed Ezeonye, Senior Pastor of Excellent Glory Christian Centre, Iju, Lagos, stated that atmosphere of God’s presence needed to be created in homes, as His presence gives every home strong defense and backbone in a volatile world. “Atmosphere of love, unity, understanding and peace are necessary for God to move on our behalf. Lack of openness creates suspicion that brings love to question. “When couples begin to hide things from each other, it’s a clear indication that love is in doubt. You remember when Adam and Eve sinned against God, they went into hiding. Love was in question and also fellowship,” he said. The cleric said that there are things couples do which discourage openness in marriage and also breed suspicion. “The church is facing serious threats from the pit of hell because of activities of many Christian homes. The seed of infidelity is spreading fast, fuelled by social media. “A husband can be in Lagos and tell the wife he is in Abuja for two days official assignment while camping with a mistress in a hotel. “Many married couples can’t expose their cell phones to each other. Calls are made and answered in hiding. Chats and text messages are read and quickly deleted. This is a dangerous development in the Christian homes. It questions the authenticity of our belief. “Some couples don’t know their partner’s financial standing and bank account details, not to talk of accessing them. This kind of situation creates problem for couples and near relatives in the event of death.” He added, “Your spouse must know everything about you to prove the scripture that says ‘two shall be one’. To the male couples and in the spirit of openness and sincerity, your movement must be known by your spouse. The male partner must be traceable. “Lack of openness is a direct consequence of lack of knowledge of the truth that is meant to set people free. Openness helps sense of fellowship and is an expression of true love. Where such is, divine presence is established and couples begin to form and look alike.” On his own, Apostle Michael Olufunmilade Alabi, the Presiding Apostle of Apostolic Mandate in Ogba, Lagos, said openness is necessary in marriages and is also recognised in the cooperate world. In his words, “Even in the cooperate world, there is a principle that is called ‘open policy’. Marriage is divine; it is an institution God himself established. Openness is a fundamental statement that even the scripture said, ‘the two were naked and they were not ashamed’. “That nakedness there means openness. Anybody that wants to marry and have the mind of secrecy is not ready for marriage and any marriage that one of the spouses is still locking a particular wardrobe or not allowing the partner access to his personal things is a marriage in default. “There must be total openness in marriage; let your spouse know how much you are earning. When I was working, my wife knew how much I was earning.” Alabi further said that marriage requires two matured people as maturity helps couples not to abuse privileges that comes with openness in marriage. “But there is a clause; when there is openness in the marriage, the husband or the wife must not abuse it. That is why couples need to be matured before going into marriage because it takes two matured people not to abuse such privilege. “But in a case where a spouse is open while the other partner is secretive, the marriage is default already. One of the critical things in marriage is openness; there must not be secrets and nothing should be hidden from each other. “Openness in marriage gives it confidence and makes the bond strong. Because of secrecy in marriage, most spouses don’t know the banks their spouse operate, not to talk of amount in such bank accounts. Many of such monies are trapped in the bank without anybody laying claim on them. Some women even build houses without the knowledge of their husbands.” Adding his voice, Archbishop George Amu, the General Overseer of Goodnews Miracle Bible Church and Vice Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in 17 Southern states of Nigeria, who has been married for 52 years, shared how couples could achieve happiness in their union. “I am standing not because I am a preacher but because I followed my father’s example to live a life of sincerity. My father, a retired Commissioner of Police, will always tell us to be the best we can be wherever we are because nobody knows tomorrow. “I then became popular in St. Gregory College as footballer of the year, football captain, trustee member and all those posts got me. But my father’s counsel made me calm down so I followed his example and I thank God for ordering my footsteps. “My greatest joy before I had a stroke is that for 25 years, I never stepped into any hospital for any treatment but see as I am now. My teeth are alright, my hair colour still dark and I will be 78 years old this year, and it’s the grace of God so I don’t take that grace for granted.” Continuing on how to avoid separation or divorce, he urged couples to imbibe humility and try to understand one another. “It is about understanding; couples do not want to humble themselves. My wife said ‘she became a fool to George and George became a bigger fool to me’, that is life; no confrontation.  There is no issue that cannot be resolved amicably especially when the parties involved are humble and do not find it difficult to use the word, ‘I’m sorry’. There is nobody you will say I’m sorry to ‘wey him head no go come down’. “The mistake some women make is that they confront their husbands, not direct confrontation but attitudinal confrontation and once you overcome that, God will help you. I am not the best husband but I put myself under control and once you do that, peace will take control,” the Archbishop said. Specifically addressing the issue of infidelity, which has unarguably been the major cause of marital problem and the unpopular notion that it is difficult to find men who do not cheat on their wives, he said, “It’s a wrong statement that people especially cannot do without cheating; I tell you that there are people who are faithful to their spouses. “What is faithfulness? Faithfulness means that you know yourself; you walk in the way of the Lord and keep your house in order. You don’t have to mess yourself up by sleeping with the girls or women you see.” Pastor Esther Unen is the resident pastor of Grace Imparts Church, Ifako, Lagos. She believes that couples should be transparent in all they do, even in things that have to do with their finances. “Honestly, I believe in joint account but I have my own personal account and my husband has his and for the joint account, we put something there as well. “We believe in transparency and I will advise couples to be transparent in their dealings. My husband knows every income that comes to me and I know every income that goes to him; we run an open policy,” Unen said. The post To What Extent Has Openness Impacted On Marriages?
