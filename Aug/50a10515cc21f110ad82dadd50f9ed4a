 NGOZI UMA, SEYI TAIWO-OGUNTUAWASE ‘Hero worship’ or what is termed in popular parlance as ‘eye service worship’ has found its way into the Churches, particularly Pentecostal Churches where Senior Pastors or General Overseers are always in charge of ministration. Whenever these Senior Pastors or General Overseers are not around, their absence is noticeably felt and followed by absence of some key members of the Church. In some instances, the members will actually be in Church physically,but will demonstrate absent-mindedness in activities because the one they feel they are out to ‘impress’ is not around. A sister from a Pentecostal church in Ogba, Lagos, revealed to SUNDAY INDEPENDENT why she preferred to stay at home when her Senior Pastor was not around; she said, “My Church is a prophetic ministry. I enjoy going to Church when my pastor is around because at least there is hope of getting a prophecy, and God is using him well. “If he is not around, his wife will be the one ministering, she does not preach the word of God; all she will do throughout the service is to preach condemning words to young girls who she perceives to be jealous of her and she brags about her achievements. You don’t expect me to go to Church and listen to such words; her preaching dampens my spirit,” the sister lamented. However, observers want the mindset of many Christians, who believe that only their Senior Pastors or Daddy G.Os can pray and minister to them before they can get their prayers answered, to have a change of heart. They also called on pastors to check the misconception in the body of Christ before it is overblown. Rev. (Dr) Sam Anya, Presiding Pastor of The United Church of Christ (Fountain of Peace), Ijaiye, Lagos, said major factors that could make Church members to have hero-worship mentality is ignorance, followed by the culture of reverence to man rather than God. “Yes, the Senior Pastor can be more anointed but we do not come to Church to worship him but God. If worshippers know that they come to Church to worship God and not man, such scenario wouldn’t have been there. “They (worshippers) would have known that God is a permanent feature; whether the Senior Pastor is present or not, God is ever present. Again, in those churches where the Senior Pastor is seen and taught to be second god, his absence in a given service means that God is absent. “Many senior pastors are enjoying it not knowing that they are misleading the people of God; that is why any time they will not be in a given service, they will announce it because he is the one people are worshipping,” he said. Anya added, “By the grace of God in my local Church, I am the only pastor, so if I claim to be the senior pastor there, I may not be wrong. Any time I will not be in the Church, I don’t publish it; I will only inform the person that will stand for me in the service and some elders for administrative purposes. “I know that God can use anybody He likes to bless His children and in doing that, my absence becomes inconsequential. Let the people be taught that they are coming to Church to worship God not any human; and senior pastors should stop announcing their intending absence.” On his own, Pastor James Ajibike of Christ Apostolic Church, Garment of Glory, Ojodu, Lagos, agreed to the assertion, noting that General Overseers are to be blamed for placing themselves in a position that make members to have misconception of their personality. “The observation is very accurate and undiluted. The Bible says in John chapter 4 verse 23 ‘But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.’ “Meanwhile, these set of people need not to be blamed because many General Overseers, founders and Senior Pastors have placed themselves in the position of God in all their presentations. We can’t overemphasis that God is using them and that great manifestation of God’s miracles were evident through them. “Most of them present themselves to the worshippers rather than presenting God to them. Some of them do say in the telecast that ‘come and meet me tomorrow instead of meeting God’. “Another cause is that these set of Senior Pastors usually evaluate and condemn the messages or characters of the junior pastors and workers under them either openly or secretly before the congregation,” he said. Ajibike concluded: “To correct the impression that has registered in the lives of such Church members, it will take the grace of God because it has accustomed them though there’s nothing that prayer cannot do. “But the Senior Pastors that have identified such occurrences in their respective Churches need to take prompt step to alter its existence. It’s a big lesson to the upcoming men of God to be extraordinary careful and vigilant not to allow such to happen in their respective Churches.” Bishop Gbenga Ajadi of His Praise Deliverance Chapel, Lagos, regretted that many Christians believe in their pastors more than they believe in God. He said, “Nowadays, people worship human being not God; it happens everywhere. When the General Overseers or Senior Pastors are around, the Church will be crowded. ‘Eye service’ is common among Church members nowadays, some believe if the Senior Pastor is not around, the anointing or miracle will not flow. “Misconception about worshiping God is true and common in the Church. Some believe their Senior Pastor more than God. God have mercy on us! These things happen in my Church too; any time I am traveling, I don’t tell my Church members except Church workers, so that it would not affect Church activities. “I keep telling them that Jesus Christ is the miracle worker not any Senior Pastor or General Overseer; I also tell my Church members that I am an ordinary human being like them and that they should focus on God, the author and finisher of our faith.” Ajadi continued, “Hypocrisy is common in the Church nowadays because some will want the Senior Pastor to know they are around but if the Senior Pastor is not around, they will not come to Church. “People need to know that in God’s presence, anointing will flow whether the Senior Pastor is around or not. We should stop worshiping human beings; we should worship God. God alone is the miracle worker not any Senior Pastor.” The cleric agreed that his Church is not exempted from such act, as he called on Church leaders to present God and not themselves to their congregants. “I observed that in my Church, if am around people will come to Church but if I am not around some will not come; this belief must stop in the body of Christ. It’s a bad attitude towards God that needs urgent attention in our churches. “We Senior Pastors should always tell our Church members to believe God not us. They can only respect us as their General Overseers but they should focus on God. The Bible says ‘those who worship God shall worship him in truth and in spirit’. “Going to Church is to worship God not Senior Pastors and I want anyone with such mindset to discard it. If your Senior Pastor is not around, you should go to Church. God is the owner of the Church, not Senior Pastors. “It is the truth that you know that shall set you free. The Bible says that we should always fellowship with one another. Church members should not be absent from Church whether the Senior Pastor is there or not if there is no genuine reasons for them to be absent,” he said. Pastor Ayodeji Olulani, the Executive Director, Christian and Citizens Empowerment Foundation, in his view, described such attitude as idolatry, where divine honour is given to man. In his words, “The attitude of most Church members interested in going to Church only when the senior pastor is ministering can be simply be called hero-worshipping. “Hero-worshipping can be described as idolatry, where divine honour is given to created being or given to any human over God’s will or His person. The three Abrahamic religions, Christianity, Islam and Judaism strongly condemn the worship of other gods or objects. “It is a grievous sin for anyone or objects to take the place of God in one’s heart. The person who on the other hand accepts to be worshipped is of Satan. Satan desires to be worshipped. God desires that He and He alone should be worshipped.” He added, “The attitude of hero-worship by Christians is condemnable on the part of the misinformed worshippers and also the man being worshipped. The object of worship is taking the place and honour due to God. God detests the act of idolatry. “It is the responsibility of a church leader to discourage his congregants from giving him preference or reverence over God through divesting himself of attention and glorification of himself by his Church members. Whatever he does is not by his power or ability but simply by the power of God, who must at all times receive the glory.” Bishop Emmanuel Udah of Peace and Joy International Ministry, Akowonjo, Lagos, on his own submission, called on Pastors to turn and direct the attention of their members from himself to God. “I want every preacher to turn and direct the attention of their members from himself to God. Build their faith solidly on God’s word, not on your preaching skills. “If Church leaders stay within the purpose of the commission, they would have more committed believers in their Ajibike Ajadi Anya pews. We should be making disciples and not just having members. Our calling was to raise disciples that will raise disciples and in turn raise more disciples. This is ultimately the purpose of the church. “You will not have ineffective believers if you build them around Jesus Christ. “But if you build them around yourself, what you will get are bunch of shallow Christians who know nothing else other than what their pastor tells them,” he said. The cleric attributed ‘hero worship’ to lack of sound doctrine. “When sound doctrine is lacking in the altar, you will get lousy followership in the pews. For material and financial gains, preachers hardly preach the undiluted and infallible word of God. “Jesus said in Mark chapter 7 verse13 ‘One can make the word of God of no effect by the tradition of men’, the Just shall live by his/her faith and not on the faith of his pastor. “A lot is wrong with the way the Church is presently composed that requires a revolutionary approach to correct if indeed we sincerely and honestly desire the kind of revival that will impact the world,” he said. Udah added, “Presently, there’s no corresponding effect between the number of proclaiming Christians and their impact in the society. All you hear is ‘My bishop says’, ‘Daddy or Mummy G.O. says’, ‘My pastor says’. These are signs of immaturity and childishness. “You must grow in faith at your pace. Know the word of God. Search and study the scriptures. Hear from God directly yourself,” he said. The post How ‘Hero Worship’ Is Damaging Core Tenets Of Christianity  Source: Independent
