About Tanqueray Charles Tanqueray was born in 1810 to a long line of English clergymen; father, grandfather and great uncle. Naturally, when it became time to pick a career, Tanqueray went with booze, founding a distillery with his brother in London in 1830. While developing what would become his flagship recipe, Tanqueray stumbled upon his preferred method for distilling botanicals into a small quantity of neutral grain spirit before distilling the larger batch for the final time. It was one of the first innovations in botanical infusion, central to the whole “how-is-this-delicious-gin-not-vodka?” question. Tanqueray is a dry, crisp gin with a rich jumper flavor that makes the most refreshing tasting gin and tonics with the driest of martini cocktails.            —————————————————————————————————————————————Sponsored Content  The post Denola Grey, Eku Edewor, Lala Alakija Enjoy a Fashion Night-Out with Clan & Tanqueray | Highlights appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
