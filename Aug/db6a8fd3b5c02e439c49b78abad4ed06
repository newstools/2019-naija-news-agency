Samuel L. Jackson is currently on a visit to African countries Gabon and Ghana, to shoot a documentary on slavery and he is excited to share his experience with his fans. The 70-year-old award-winning actor and film producer arrived in Ghana from Gabon where he traced his roots to. An Instagram post by Efe Ogbeni also said Jackson has obtained his Gabonese passport. The movie star is obviously enjoying his time in West Africa and the photos and videos below prove it!   It was an honor and a gift to meet you @president_abo and @sylviabongo Thank you for the wonderful reception and for giving me such a warm welcome to Gabon!
