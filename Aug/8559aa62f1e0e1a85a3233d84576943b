 Manchester United are still working hard to bring in a £100m Lazio midfielder, while Tottenham have been told to up their bid for a playmaker, according to Tuesday’s European press. Manchester United are still working on a deal for Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, according to Spanish outlet Marca. Lazio’s Serbian midfielder has long been linked to Old Trafford, with a fee in the region of £100m being mooted. The Daily Express recently claimed that the deal is off, but now reports in Spain claim otherwise and that talks are advanced stage between the two clubs. The news coincides with Real Madrid reportedly making a last-ditch effort to take Paul Pogba to the Bernabeu. Marca (once again), states that the Spanish giants are desperate to sign the midfielder, who clearly wants out of Manchester – and United’s links to the more defensive-minded Milinkovic-Savic and goal machine Bruno Fernandes appear to nod to them considering the possibility of letting the France star leave. Tottenham star Christian Eriksen also remains a target, although it appears more likely that he would head abroad after Thursday’s window has closed for Premier League clubs.
