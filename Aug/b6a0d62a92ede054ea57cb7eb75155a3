 US billionaire, 66, Jeffrey Epstein has reportedly committed suicide at the Manhattanâ€™s Metropolitan Correctional Center where he was being held without bail after being arrested on 6th July for child sex trafficking. According to The Independent, Epstein reportedly hung himself overnight and was found dangling by 7:30 a.m on Saturday, August 10. He was transported from jail to New York Downtown Hospital where he was found to be in cardiac arrest at the time of arrival before being confirmed dead. Before this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch. Manhattan federal prosecutors charged Epstein with sex trafficking of girls as young as 14, and details of his behaviour have been emerging for years. The financier with opulent homes, a private jet and access to elite circles, had been dogged for decades by accusations that he had paid dozens of girls for sexual acts in Florida. The one-time friend of Bill Clinton and Donald Trump faced a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison. The post US Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein allegedly Commits Suicide in Manhattan Prison  Source: 36Ng
