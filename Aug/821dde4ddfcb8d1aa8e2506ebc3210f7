 Kimse Okoko is a retired Professor of Political Science, University of Port Harcourt and former President, Ijaw National Congress (INC). In this interview with DANIEL ABIA, he took a swipe at the Federal Government on how Omoyele Sowore, Presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC) is being treated as a terrorist for leading the #RevolutionNow mass protest, among other issues. Excerpts: How would you define a revolution in the context of a constitutional democracy? *Well, revolution has its intrinsic meaning. Whether it is violent or peaceful, all revolutions attempt to change a constituted government – a regime change. Look at what is happening in Venezuela for instance. It may be said to be a peaceful revolution if they succeed because it is all about protests and slight civil disobedience here and there. Of course, peaceful revolutions are possible as we witnessed in the Arab Springs. But, the difference between violent and peaceful revolution is the fact that violent revolutions are much more comprehensive. It shakes a society to its very foundation. It fundamentally dismantles and changes the architecture of the society. But, with a peaceful change, you might remove a president, but the structures which were also part of the agitation in the first place are still there. So, you now have to get on with changing the structures. That process may become even more cumbersome and protracted as more resistance and opposition may have been generated in various quarters. That is what happened with the Arab Spring. They wanted a peaceful revolution. But, look at the chaos that is left with them even after the Presidents had been removed. Splinter groups will come up. Regional war lords will hold sway in some areas and the entire country will wallow in that quagmire for a long time. That is why I say this country must be comprehensively restructured if we must move forward. Most of the problem with this country lies in the over-concentration of power and wealth at the centre. Until we change this constitutional structure, we will not see the positive changes we desperately require and that change must go the whole hog. It is not a question of constitutional amendment. That is where I disagree with those parliamentarians who behave like spoilt children. They earn N35million as Senators and N25 millions as House of Representatives members a month in a country where some people earn N18, 000 as monthly salary. That is criminal and where 64 million Nigerians still live below the poverty line, there can be no peace under such circumstances. It is the constitution that creates the system. Imagine a system that allows a sitting President, who is a card carrying member of a political party, to decide who becomes the electoral umpire, the Inspector General of Police and even the Attorney General and Chief Justice of the Federation. How can we, in all honesty expect non-partisanship from these office holders? How can these people and the bodies they represent be truly independent? These are key parts of the system. That is why you find out in this country that the Legislature and the Judiciary are usually under the thumb of the president. It is even worse in the states. The State Assemblies are usually playgrounds for the governors. The State House of Assembly members are merely babysitters as far as the governors are concerned. I will keep on hammering on it. Restructure this country, or remain on this slippery path towards a disaster waiting to happen. Is the Federal Government right to say that Omoyele Sowore committed terrorison by planning a peaceful protest? The answer is ‘No’. The Federal Government is unnecessarily punitive. It is a gross abuse of power. But, I will say that Sowore exposed himself to this template by his choice of words. Revolution has its meanings and it is the meaning that the government is gladly clinging on to as if it is manna from heaven for them. It is definitely wrong for them to charge him for terrorism or treason. These are people who gather to express their dissatisfaction with the way the country is being misruled. You have not tagged the rifle-wielding Miyetti Allah and Fulani herdsmen as terrorist groups. But, you want to say Sowore is a terrorist simply because he planned a peaceful protest? It is a shameless way to abuse power. The only caveat I see is that he, Sowore, should have understood that we are now at the door step of a full blown dictatorship in the country and Buhari is now showing his full colour as a military General he was and is never a democrat. He has zero tolerance for dissenting views. Sowore played into their hands. You do not play with words. They have meanings and essence. Words have lives of their own. So, someone is now being punished for a crime he did not commit, while the real criminals are winning and dining at government’s tables. That is the tragedy of the Nigerian situation. He did not commit any terrorist act, although he used the word ‘revolution’ glibly. He should not have taken the word ‘revolution’ so lightly. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo recently raised an alarm about the plan to Fulanise and Islamise Nigeria. Do you think his fears were genuine, or was he simply being an alarmist? I have not been a sympathiser of Chief Obasanjo because I believe he has been a major contributor to the problems of this country. But, I believe he was honest and sincere with those statements he made. To a large extent, his statements reflect the realities of our society today. So, I will not castigate him even though I disagree with him most of the times. You do not have to like the face of the messenger before scrutinising the message he brings. Historically, religious wars have been some of the worst wars in societies. That is why I have always been circumspect when such terms as Islamisation, etc, are freely used because of my concerns of the devastation religious war can bring to any society. Having said so, his statements should also be a warning to the powers-that-be for them to apply caution and reason if they want to maintain Nigeria as one peaceful and progressive entity. If you study the Fulani history of conquests and relate it with this repackaged policy of RUGA and the obvious executive clannishness, you can see some elements of truth in what Chief Obasanjo said. Ruga has been described by many as one of the worst policies of this administration. Do you subscribe to that line of thought? Of course, I do. RUGA is another word for cattle colonies. Why do you want to force RUGA on all the communities in this country? There is a comparative advantage in some parts of the country for cattle rearing and they are the ones that have been producing cattle in the country. I am not being ethnic here, but common sense tells us that the application of comparative advantages in economic planning and production is taken for granted. So, if this is not a sinister agenda, create ranches in those places where there are comparative advantages so that cows stop roaming everywhere. You see cows on the highways, in the university environment and even at airports. I support ranching and completely reject RUGA in whatever guise. It must be fully condemned by all reasonable people and government must not fund private enterprises. The owners of these cows are big and influential men in the society. Most herders do not own cows. The owners are financially capable of building ranches. Nigerians have become easy preys to xenophobic attacks around the world. What is the protective foreign policy thrust of this administration? It is part of the reason I said I cannot point at any success story of this administration. If there is any foreign policy at all, then it must be the foggiest foreign policy I have seen in post-independent Nigeria. You really cannot point to what it is. In the early days of independence, we had clear foreign policy goals. lt was described as concentric circles. It means taking care of our country and immediate neighbors, Africa and beyond in that order on all issues in international relations. That policy thrust carried on for a long time as evident in the crucial role we played in the decolonisation process of other African states and  which certainly earned us great respect and recognition  both at home in Africa and in the comity of nations. But who respects us these days? If you go abroad and you cannot express yourself on mundane issues, how can you elaborate on complex foreign policy issues? Quite frankly and without any form of being derogatory, I do not know the current foreign policy thrust of this administration. Other than trying to consolidate our position at the Organisation of Islamic Country, (OIC), which is part of the divisiveness we talked about.
