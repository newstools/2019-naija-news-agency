This week, it’s like the world went back to being upside-down. Everyone was just mad and upset and things weren’t just normal. Think we’re exaggerating? See for yourself. Mona Lisa on Braids As per fine babe, one girl on Twitter wanted to celebrate herself, so she shared a photo of herself. But she didn’t quite get the response she expected. Why? Because she wore braids. Black women on Twitter entered the same trousers with the babe. They told her she wasn’t pretty. They told her she was appropriating their culture. They told her to take her braids off. They said they’re regularly criticised for wearing the same hairstyle, so the hispanic woman must take out her braids. It’s 2019, two wrongs make a right! Surely, her taking our her braids will make braids a more acceptable hairdo for black women. mona lisa pic.twitter.com/xkdX1N2JRF — tiffany.chantal (@mooonprincessx) June 3, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Y’all really expect bw to take these things as a compliment, when just 10 years ago we were literally bullied for our culture. Now a white girl tears her edges lose & were the haters. Like we didn’t just get laws passed in 2019 allowing us to wear these styles w/o consequences🥴 https://t.co/6pyLItYddD — Jonne Mae 🌺 (@Jonne_Mae) August 4, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js No one is saying she looks bad.

Nigerians will see women in bikini and be shouting end time, but their pastors are rapists and their politicians are stealing and the world is not coming to an end. But that is not even the issue. The issue is the smelling statement the Federal Government released. The same government that runs this country oo. Talking about it being “‘Jezebelistic” and a sin “against the Nigerian culture.” Biko, what is a sin against culture again? And since when is being a Jezebel a crime? Na inside 2000BC Rome we dey? Dear FG, the problem here is public indecency. Remove religion and face the law. People who have absolutely no idea what the Nigerian culture is, who have been reset with colonial settings, talking about it destroying “centuries-old and rich Nigerian culture.” Please 🙄. Ok.

This just reinforces that belief.

It shows what people will tolerate and what they won’t. Suffering, deaths and poverty are a-okay. Twerking though? Women’s rights? Music? LGBT rights?

It’s become our reality now, for the government to detain dissenters. That is what Nigeria has become. And it’s gotten worse. Nigerians went out en masse to protest and what happened?
