 Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer held talks with Tottenham star Christian Eriksen regarding a summer transfer, according to the Manchester Evening News . But it is claimed that, after gauging interest from the Danish player, it became clear he was more interested in a move to Spain rather than a Premier League rival. The Red Devils were tipped to make a late switch for Eriksen with Real Madrid not making a move as Spurs face losing him on a free transfer next summer. But a personal discussion between Solskjaer and Eriksen saw the club find that, despite admiring United, his preferred move was elsewhere. There were also concerns over Real Madrid’s role in the potential transfer, with the Spanish club said to be lobbying Spurs to gain interest from United in order to place uncertainty on Paul Pogba’s future and allow them to pounce. The Red Devils failed to land a new midfielder, with criticism from some quarters for their failure to replace Ander Herrera. A move for Bruno Fernandes being derailed by Sporting Lisbon’s transfer fee and concerns over him losing possession too regularly. But Solskjaer appears to have seen off interest in Pogba, with the midfielder committing to staying focused this season with the club refusing to sell now their deadline to replace him has passed. Eriksen, meanwhile, could still be on the move. The deadline for European clubs to sign players is not until September 2, and Real Madrid could still make a move with other clubs also interested. Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino left Eriksen out of his starting line-up against Aston Villa at the weekend, although he came on and made an impact as they came from behind to secure three points. Juventus are another club said to be keen, but they are happy to wait to land him on a free at the end of the season, as they have done with Aaron Ramsey and Adrien Rabiot this summer.
