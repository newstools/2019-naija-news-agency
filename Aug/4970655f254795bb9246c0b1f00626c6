 LAGOS – Senator Rochas Okorocha, a former governor of Imo State, has told Paschal Dozie, Charles Ugwu, Luke Ochulor, Lambert Iheanacho, and others who claimed to be Imo State elders that they were not in the capacity to speak for Imo elders because they are chieftains of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and could not assess his administration objectively. The senator, in a statement made available to journalists on Tuesday by Sam Onwuemeodo, his special adviser on Media, stated that the PDP chieftains had claimed that he left the state in a dilapidated condition and had in a bid to give credibility to their claim, said that they were speaking on behalf of Imo Elders Forum during a dinner they had with Governor Emeka Ihedioha in Owerri. Okorocha said he had more than 1000 verifiable projects to his credit and that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo commissioned some of them, including two flyovers, two tunnels, hospitals, roads and many others. He pointed out that the Ooni of Ife and Sultan of Sokoto were at different times in the state to commission projects. The former governor also noted that the Chief Justice of the Federation, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, was in Owerri to commission the Justice Oputa High Court Complex. He maintained that non-partisan Imo elders would not have pretended not to know that Imo had free education at all levels under him and that administration developed Owerri, the state capital, opened roads and made the state among fast growing states in the country. He said that it was evident that Dozie and the members of his family were PDP members, contesting elections on the tickets the party. He said that Dozie’s cohort, Ugwu, was the gubernatorial candidate of PDP in 2007 until the court awarded victory Ifeanyi Araraume. While appealing to the general public to disregard all the fclaims, he said that all those who had written or spoken against him did not want the progress of the state.
