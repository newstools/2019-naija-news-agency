 A Mombasa based Kenyan chef, Maliha Mohammed has broken the Guinness World Record for the longest time spent cooking. CGTN Africa reports that Chef Maliha cooked for 75 hours non-stop, setting the new record on Sunday, August 18 at Kenya Bay Beach Resort in Mombasa.  The previous longest cooking marathon was 68 hours 30 minutes 01 seconds, and was achieved by Rickey Lumpkin in Los Angeles, USA, in 2018. 36-year-old Maliha had prepared a list of 400 recipes of local and international cuisines for the competition to have her name on the Guinness Book of World Records.  The food she prepared will be offered to charity homes and orphanages as part of her initiative to raise awareness and to feed the less fortunate in Mombasa.
