 The ruling of the Kaduna Central Senatorial District Election Petition Tribunal against Senator Shehu Sani has been described as a rape on democracy and coronation of judicial fraud. This was the position of the Peoples Redemption Party, PRP following the decision of the Elections Petition Tribunal against its candidate at the 2019 Kaduna Central Senatorial District Elections. The PRP, in a statement signed by the Kaduna State chairman, Alhaji Abdulrahaman Danbirni and made available to Independent on Thursday, August 22 in Kaduna, claimed its candidate was the actual winner of the polls. “The PRP Kaduna state chapter rejects and condemns the ruling of the State and National Assembly Elections Tribunal on the petition brought before it on the 2019 National Assembly Elections with regards to our candidate, Distinguished Senator Shehu Sani”. “The Justice A.H Suleiman ruling was nothing but a Judicial coronation of fraud. Two hours of hot air wasted to canonize chicanery”, it stated. It further outlined that; “We wish to bring to spotlight that the tribunal: (1)Failed to grant our request for a recount of the votes. (2)The defendant, the APC candidate, never presented even a single witness to the court to justify his victory. (3)The lawyer that represented INEC is Governor Elrufai’s personal Attorney. (4)The Tribunal didn’t inform the legal counsel of our candidate Distinguished Senator Shehu Sani of the date of the ruling. “The ruling represents a rape of justice and the crowning and glorification of electoral robbery”. The party maintained that its candidate for the 2019 National Assembly Elections Distinguished Senator Shehu Sani won the Kaduna Central Senatorial Election.
