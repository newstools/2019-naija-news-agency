 No doubts, it has become a trend among celebrities to show off their outfits, accessories, cars, their touring moments and other luxuries and it would be fallacious to say that celebrities donâ€™t make so much money to afford these type of luxuries. As a matter of fact, almost every celebrity in the world from actors to musicians spend as much money as they make. Fast-rising star Zlatan Ibile has also joined the bandwagon of Nigerian stars who constantly flaunt their luxurious lifestyles. He shared videos of him shopping at a boutique whilst having fun and also showed fans invoice of the items bought issued by the store attendant. The content of the invoice stated that his spending on shopping was 1.9 million naira. However, in the video, the rapper complained about the quantity of what he got. According to him, N1.9m is too much for the number of things he got.  The post Zlatan Ibile Exposes His Luxury Lifestyle After Spending 1.9 Million Naira On Fashion appeared first on . Source: 36Ng
