 New York state is moving to require safety training for anyone operating a motor boat.Under legislation signed into law last week by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the state will phase in the requirement over five years, with younger boaters required to get training first. The rule won’t apply to non-motorized boats. It’s up to the state commissioner of parks and recreation to approve specific training programs, which could include online courses. Training will include lessons on boat handling, the use of flotation devices and boating laws. Previously, the state had only required safety training for motor boat operators born after May 1, 1996. The new mandate is known as Brianna’s Law after Brianna Lieneck, an 11-year-old killed in a boating collision off Long Island in 2005.
