 The legal case between Busola Dakolo and Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of COZA, which has been going on for a few weeks, is still very much active, Busola has confirmed. Speaking up after the viral news of being coerced to sign a counter-petition against her allegations of rape, Busola wrote on Instagram: Thanks for the goodwill and best wishes. The interview with the UK Guardian was held two weeks ago when the police came to my house. It is not a new interview.
I did not sign a counter-petition or acquiesce to any counter-petition. I am very grateful for all those who have reached out, including from institutions that are to help us get justice. Our legal and police case continues. This has not ended by any chance. This is about many young girls who must know they can get justice when they speak. I continue to be resolute and thank you for standing with us. The post Busola Dakolo reacts to Reports about Countering her Rape Petition appeared first on . Source: 36Ng
