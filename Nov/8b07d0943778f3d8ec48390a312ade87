 Mighty Records release a new single titled “Omila“. The king of melody and Port-Harcourt 1st son, Duncan Mighty made this heavy jam. As we all know Wene Mighty doesn’t tap into trends, he always comes through with his own style and vibe. 2018 is a perfect year for an example, while other artistes were switching to the tend (raving music style), ‘Shaku Shaku’, Duncan came into the music scene with ‘Fake Love’, something different from the loud sound. Now he is back at it again as he ignores the Zanku sound for a new tune. ‘Omila’ is a song specially made for all the ladies with the biggest Barka, something you can’t overlook.
