Pau Torres is a product of Villarreal’s youth system. The now 22-year-old has featured 65 times for Villarreal’s B team and has also enjoyed a spell on loan with Malaga, which saw him rack up 40 appearances. Now though, after impressing on loan with Malaga, the young centre-back has been handed a chance in Villarreal’s senior side and he is certainly taking it. Torres has started in all 13 of Villarreal’s La Liga outings so far this campaign, scoring one and assisting one. Torres’ recent form has even earned him a call-up to Spain’s senior side with the Villarreal man making his debut earlier this week, coming off the bench in Spain’s 7-0 demolition of Malta. Torres would also bag himself a goal vs Malta. After his bright start to the 2019/20 campaign, Torres is now being linked with a move to the Premier League. It is Arsenal who are being mentioned in the same breath as Torres with the Sun claiming the Gunners are considering a January swoop for the Villarreal defender. However, according to the Sun, Torres has a £43m release clause in his latest contract. But the Sun also claim that fee has not put the North London outfit off with Arsenal said to be exploring a deal similar to the one that they struck with Lille for Nicolas Pepe over the summer. Lille are said to have accepted £20m upfront for Pepe with £52m to be paid later, as per the Sun. Given Arsenal’s recent form they could certainly do with some fresh legs in January. Unai Emery’s side are already eight points adrift of a Champions League spot.
