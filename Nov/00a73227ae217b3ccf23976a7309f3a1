Hamza Choudhury took Salah out, and injured his ankle in that game. In a worrying disclosure, the Times note that Salah ‚Äúhas been experiencing discomfort in the joint since then‚Äù. Salah is scheduled to play for Egypt during the international break. The Pharoahs have matches against Kenya and Comoros in the next few days. However, it‚Äôs now unclear whether Salah will play in those games due to his ankle issues. Indeed, the Times confirm that Salah will have tests in the Egyptian capital to determine the extent of his problem: Salah, 27, is scheduled to have a scan on his left ankle in Cairo when he joins up with Egypt for Thursday‚Äôs Africa Cup of Nations qualifier with Kenya. When the international break ends, Liverpool return to league action away at Crystal Palace. It‚Äôs currently too early to say whether Salah will be fit for the Crystal Palace match.
