Arsenal are set to face off with Leicester in Saturday’s late Premier League kick-off. The Gunners begin the weekend 5th in the English top-flight, two places below Leicester City. The Foxes have been in fine form of late and should they see off the North London outfit, they will open up a nine-point gap between themselves and Arsenal. Unai Emery confirmed on Friday that Granit Xhaka will once again miss out on Saturday. With Dani Ceballos also ruled out due to injury, the Gunners are looking a bit short-staffed in midfield.

Xhaka has also recently been stripped of the Arsenal captaincy. Now, when speaking about Xhaka, Emery has stated he is unsure if Xhaka will actually play for Arsenal again: “As a coach I have a responsibility for the team. “We need a player like Xhaka. But also I don’t know if he is going to play again. “I don’t know, because if he is available in his mind to continue helping us and continue defending the Arsenal shirt, I think time is giving us that solution.” As quoted by the Telegraph.
