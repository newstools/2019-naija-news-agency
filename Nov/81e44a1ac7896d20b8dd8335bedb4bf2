 On Sunday, November 10th, the nightlife scene witnessed what was described as a night of “unparalleled social experiences” at the 2nd edition of #MartellAtDusk, hosted by premium cognac house Martell, in collaboration with 24 Lifestyle.  Inspired by the success of the previous edition, the organizers went for a more sophisticated feel at the upscale “Amore Gardens” in Lekki, which made a perfect fit to accommodate all shades of free-spirited nightlife enthusiasts and lovers of cognac.   The night was hosted by “Shody the TurnUp King“, with appearances from industry players, celebrities and socialites such as Ycee, Moet Abebe, Sophie Alakija, Bolly Lomo, Kaylah Oniwo, Mimi Onalaja, Pretty Mike, Ex BBN housemates; Koko by Khloe, Avala and Isilomo, Ghanaian singer; Becca and a host of others, who showed up to the soiree in style.  Renowned celebrity photographer, Kelechi Amadi-Obi‘s lifestyle set, was the highlight of the evening, as all the guests were captured through his lenses, as they “made their statement” to the delight of the screens.   The night spurred further with the trendy & lively crowd bumping to good music from DJs Consequence, Smallz the DJ and DJ Prince, while reveling a rare combination of Martell infused wings, tasty canapés, wraps & sandwiches, alongside signature Martell cocktails.  This edition has yet again affirmed Martell and 24 Apparel’s ability to connect to its audience and serve them the best on a platter. 3rd edition of #MartellAtDusk loading Date: Sunday, December 1st, 2019         —————————————————————————————————————————————– Sponsored Content The post Wurld, DJ Consequence, Sophie Alakija, Becca show up in Style for the 2nd Edition of #MartellAtDusk appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
