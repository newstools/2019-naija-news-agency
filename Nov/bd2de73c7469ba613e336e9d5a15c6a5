Moise Kean’s father has claimed it was a mistake for his son to join Everton and suggested he should move back to Serie A with Roma. It’s not been a great start to life in England for Moise Kean. The Italian striker came with lofty expectations after a brilliant second half of last season with Juventus. However, his campaign has got off to a difficult start. Kean is yet to score a goal for Everton in his 11 appearances. He was also dropped from the matchday squad for the game against Southampton after a disciplinary breach for being late to a team meeting. Now, Kean’s father has claimed it was a mistake for his son to go to England so soon.

When asked about why his son was struggling in England, Kean’s father suggested it was because his son had gone to England too early in his career. ‘At Everton, where he is playing now, he is not settling in well. I think he was supposed to wait a few more years before he had an experience abroad. ‘If there is a possibility for him to come back to Italy, I hope he can do that, so as not to ruin him.’   Against the haters we stand.This is everybody’s game #uniforia#createdwithadidas @mbatshuayi @kepaarrizabalaga @wrightyofficial @nglkante @katiezelem @laurennjjames @adidasfootball A post shared by  MOISE KEAN  (@moise_kean) on Nov 6, 2019 at 2:14pm PST //www.instagram.com/embed.js  See also: Everton’s Moise Kean dropped vs Southampton over disciplinary breach Premier League acknowledge incorrect VAR decision during Brighton vs Everton – Telegraph Source: Great Goals
