 How have the past ten months been? What has your experience with your domestic staff been like? If you’ve had more bad days than good, and you’re on the verge of firing your staff, you might want to pause and think deeply about your hiring process before hiring a new one. Perhaps you’re new to the game and you’re just about to hire your first domestic staff? Then this is the best time to carefully evaluate your unique household needs before you make a choice, because the decision to hire a live-in or a live-out domestic staff is such a big one and should be made carefully. In a typical household, where both parents work, it can seem like a no-brainer to hire a live-in staff who can be 90% (if not totally) responsible for the kids. While this may seem logical in the interim, it is important to understand your unique situation and household needs before you decide to bring someone to live in your home. Due to bad experiences in the past, some people would rather work with a live-out; however, what they actually need is a live-in domestic staff. Please note that this piece is not to persuade you either way, rather it is to get you thinking more critically. This will help you to make an informed decision when hiring a domestic staff. Now, let’s take a look at both options individually: A live out is a staff who resumes at your residence and closes at a particular time. Just the way it is with any other employment, he or she comes in, executes the task for the day within the specified hours during and closes at a fixed time. While this option seems to be gaining popularity among many families today, here are some things to consider before you join this train. Live-in staff have been the norm for the longest time. A lot of families opt for this option when hiring because it’s what they’ve seen others do.  In a lot of cases a live-in staff just seems to be the most convenient option to make life easier for the employer, because of the 24-hour access to the staff. However, if there is a hiring error, a live-in staff can prove to be more stress than support for the employer. So, before you hire a live-in staff here are somethings to consider: As you can see neither option is absolutely better than the other. They both have their advantages and disadvantages. Now that you know what to consider in hiring a staff, which option do you think suits your unique household needs? Whichever option you decide on, I advise that you do your checks and verifications thoroughly, and always work with an agency if you can. I wish you the best in your hiring process!
