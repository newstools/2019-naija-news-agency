@justjoykendi Joy Kendi went for an artsy vibe on the  ‘gram. The influencer wore a crisp white shirt with dramatic drawing detailing on the hem, paired with on-trend black biker shorts. The stark monochromatic contrast is very viscerally appealing, and from a design perspective,we love how it melds into the hemline. She opted to style the look with contrasting snakeskin accessories, which made her ensemble even more striking . 90’s style sunglasses statement earrings and her signature platinum cut completed the look.  @justjoykendi What do you think of Joy’s outfit?
