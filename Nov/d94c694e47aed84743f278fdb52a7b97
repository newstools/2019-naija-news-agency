As per a report from the Daily Mail, Liverpool have joined a host of European heavyweights in the hunt for Jadon Sancho’s signature. 19-year-old winger Sancho proved one of the talking points of European football last season. The English youngster, who made the move to Borussia Dortmund from Man City in the summer of 2017 for £8 million, built on the potential that he showcased at the Westfalenstadion in 2017/18 with a string of sensational displays over the course of the campaign. The pace, trickery, eye for goal and creative flair possessed by Sancho have seen him rise from exciting but raw prospect to one of world football’s most highly-regarded starlets. In total, last season, the blistering wide-man racked up 13 goals and 15 assists across all competitions. In addition, he has previously been named the Bundesliga Player of the Month, and has already been handed 10 senior caps by England, despite having only turned 19 in March. The time has finally come… 🥁 After an incredible month with @BlackYellow, Jadon Sancho has been named October’s #BundesligaPOTM 🐝 Congratulations, @Sanchooo10 🎉 @EASPORTSFIFA 💿 #FIFA19 pic.twitter.com/H23HivmbHh — Bundesliga English (@Bundesliga_EN) November 16, 2018 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js All told, across 71 appearances in Dortmund’s colours, Sancho has notched 18 goals and 31 assists. As such, Sancho’s stellar form in Germany has inevitably seen the teen linked with a potential return to the Premier League. The likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal have all been named as expressing an interest in the Dortmund starlet, with suggestions having also circulated that Sancho could make a surprise return to the Etihad with Man City. As per the aforementioned report from the Daily Mail, though, another of English football’s heavyweights are now also ready to throw their hat into the ring for the explosive attacker. The outfit in question are Liverpool. The European champions are said to be eager to add to their attacking options beyond lethal front-3 Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino. And Sancho, despite his hefty price-tag, is now viewed as a potential target for Jurgen Klopp and co. This, meanwhile, comes amid claims that Sancho has set his sights on a Westfalenstadion departure next summer. Amid a trying period of late, during which the Englishman was hooked during the first-half of Dortmund’s 4-0 drubbing at the hands of Bayern Munich (and subsequently criticised by manager Lucien Favre) last weekend, Sancho has reportedly become unsettled. Lucian Favre on why Jadon Sancho was replaced in the first-half vs. Bayern Munich: “He was not injured, he trained yesterday. I had to go on what I was seeing and, to be honest, it was not good enough.” pic.twitter.com/PEPoIDKJaI — Squawka News (@SquawkaNews) November 11, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As such, a frantic race for the prodigious talent’s signature, between the aforementioned Premier League giants, as well as the likes of PSG, Barcelona and Real Madrid, could well be in the offing next summer.
