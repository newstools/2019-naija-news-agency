Crushing stereotypes and challenging norms has become the mission of a fearless ‘plus-size’ male model and stylist. Tevin Evans, aka ‘Fat Chuck Bass’, has taken it on himself to help change the landscape of male fashion and modelling by promoting a message of inclusivity. The 27-year-old, who lives in Brooklyn, USA, says he wants to make diversity the norm within the industries he loves, and that plus-size men are a lot more than “sweatpants and sneakers.” He told Barcroft TV: “Why is it that as a plus size guy, you guys feel like I just want to wear sweatpants and a pair of sneakers and a hoodie? … There are plus sized models that should be on the front page of your website with everybody else, we are beautiful”.
