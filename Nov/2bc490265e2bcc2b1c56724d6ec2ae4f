Sunday. Anfield. Liverpool take on Man City in the match of the Premier League season so far this weekend. City, who have lost to Wolves and Norwich, are six points behind Liverpool before the game. Liverpool have won 10 matches and drawn once this league campaign. Ahead of Sunday’s clash, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp appear to be embroiled in mind-games. Guardiola started the jabs last weekend when he suggested that Sadio Mane was a diver. He said: What Liverpool has done in the last few years, it’s because they are a special talent, sometimes [because of] diving. That provoked Klopp into the following reponse on Monday: I am not too sure if I want to put oil on the fire. I am not interested in these kind of things. And I promise not to mention tactical fouls.   “I’m not really in the Man City mood” 🙄 . .Jurgen Klopp defends @sadiomaneofficiel after Pep Guardiola labelled the forward ‘a diver!’ 👀 . . . . . . . . . .#klopp #football #mane #pep #championsleague A post shared by  HaytersTV (@hayterstv) on Nov 4, 2019 at 7:12am PST //www.instagram.com/embed.js On Tuesday, in his presser before Atalanta vs Man City in the Champions League, Guardiola somewhat walked back his comments about Liverpool, Mane and diving: It was far away from my intention to say Sadio is this type of player [a diver] because I admire him a lot. For Jürgen [the Leicester incident] is a penalty, for the referee it was a penalty, for the VAR it was a penalty. I was wrong or maybe not, I don’t know. Like Jürgen said, he knows Sadio better than me.   Pep Guardiola backtracks on his @sadiomaneofficiel diving claims and speaks of his admiration for the @liverpoolfc star 🤨 . . . . . . . . . .#city #liverpool #pep #klopp #mane A post shared by  HaytersTV (@hayterstv) on Nov 5, 2019 at 1:34pm PST //www.instagram.com/embed.js Guardiola was then asked for comment in reaction to Klopp’s “tactical fouls” statement. The Man City manager tactfully dodged offering a direct response as he adopted Klopp’s turn of phrase: I don’t put oil in the fire.

Switching topics, it was confirmed on Tuesday that Liverpool will soon play two matches in two days on two different continents.
