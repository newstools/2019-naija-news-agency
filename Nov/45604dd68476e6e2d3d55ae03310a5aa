Former Manchester United star Romelu Lukaku has opened up on his departure from the club, confirming that, if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had had his way, the striker would have stayed put. Following months of rampant speculation, confirmation of Lukaku’s United exit finally arrived early in August. The Belgian secured a deadline day move to Serie A giants Inter Milan, for a fee which could eventually reach almost £74 million: 🚨 | BIG ANNOUNCEMENT@RomeluLukaku9 è un giocatore dell’Inter! 🇧🇪⚫🔵 👉🏻 https://t.co/OPIzhuG3F6#WelcomeRomelu #NotForEveryone #FCIM pic.twitter.com/zoPO8QCo8A — Inter (@Inter) August 8, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js United’s decision to part ways with Lukaku came after the 26-year-old struggled to just 15 goals across all competitions last season. In addition, the more high-tempo, technical brand of football which Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been attempting to implement is evidently far more suited to some of the other attacking options at the disposal of the Norwegian tactician. Nevertheless, though, Lukaku has today revealed that his former boss actually wanted him to remain at Old Trafford for this season. Speaking in an interview with Belgian outlet Het Belang van Limburg, the 26-year-old opened up on his United exit, first confirming that he made his mind up to seek out a new challenge long before the summer transfer window opened: ‘Solskjaer has my eternal respect. He understood me when I said in March that it was time for me to leave England.’ Lukaku went on to add: ‘I have been in the Premier League as an 18-year-old boy and now I am 26. Solskjaer wanted to keep me. But I was ready for something new.’ The Belgian has gone on to enjoy a fruitful start to life in Italy, having notched 9 goals across 12 Serie A appearances, including a crucial brace at Bologna earlier this month.
