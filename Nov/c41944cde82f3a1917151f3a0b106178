Rhian Brewster is a product of Liverpool’s youth system. The now 19-year-old has been a standout star for Liverpool’s under-23 side, scoring 13 and assisting 10 in 28 games. Brewster is also a regular feature for England’s youth sides, racking up 23 appearances for the Three Lions’ under-17 team. However, Brewster has struggled to cement a place in Liverpool’s senior side, making just two appearances for them. Both of those appearances came this season in the League Cup Now, with Jurgen Klopp seemingly not needing Brewster’s services too much, could we see the young attacker loaned out? According to the Mirror, Klopp revealed on Friday that he was willing to let Brewster go out on loan for the second half of the season. The same report from the Mirror goes on to claim Premier League new boys Aston Villa are leading the race to sign Brewster on loan: Liverpool starlet Rhian Brewster is a loan target for several clubs in January — with Aston Villa leading the race. //www.instagram.com/embed.js As well as Brewster, Villa are being mentioned in the same breath as Brentford starlet, Said Benrahma.
