Chelsea midfielder Willian is once again being linked with a move to Barcelona by Spanish daily Mundo Deportivo on Monday. This is the second time in under a week that MD have pushed this Willian-Barcelona story. 🗞️ La portada del miércoles 13 de noviembre 🧐 'Atentos a Willian'https://t.co/Zgcj1TOR20 pic.twitter.com/JVzBf2KKD4 — Mundo Deportivo (@mundodeportivo) November 12, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Willian’s contract at Stamford Bridge expires at the end of the season. Indeed, Willian can start talking to foreign clubs from January. So what’s new in today’s Willian update? Hola, aquí os dejamos la portada de este lunes #portada #deporte https://t.co/1KnhxPK7Mq pic.twitter.com/5FVnrN6seV — Mundo Deportivo (@mundodeportivo) November 17, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Mundo Deportivo claim that Willian is in “no hurry” to sign a contract extension at Stamford Bridge, even though Chelsea have reportedly offered the 31-year-old Brazilian a fresh two-year deal. The Spanish daily report: The Brazilian is very comfortable in London and feels valued at the Blues, but he has never hidden his dream of signing for Barca. It’s worth noting, however, that MD confirm that Barcelona are yet to table an official offer for Willian. Mundo Deportivo further speculate that Juventus may consider trying to sign Willian at the end of the season. Have you heard the story about how John Terry was a key character in Sergio Aguero signing for Man City? On Monday in the Athletic, reporter Simon Johnson turns back the clock to report on how Chelsea could have signed Aguero. Of course, this story is being told before Chelsea travel to Man City in the Premier League on Saturday. Aguero joined Man City in 2011 from Atletico Madrid for £38 million. However, prior to joining the Sky Blues, Chelsea tabled several offers for Aguero: The January window came and went with no agreement. Chelsea made an offer of £30 million, but that was significantly below Atletico’s asking price. The thrust of Simon Johnson’s article, however, centred on John Terry’s analysis of Aguero: The Athletic understands Terry wasn’t a huge fan of Aguero’s abilities and passed that opinion on to the powerbrokers at the club. Indeed, after playing against him on both occasions in the Champions League, Terry wasn’t overly impressed by Aguero’s movement — despite his superb double in Spain.
