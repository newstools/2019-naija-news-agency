Should Tottenham beat Crvena Zvezda on Wednesday night, Spurs will be in a solid position to progress in this seasonâ€™s Champions League. Lose, and Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s side will face an almighty battle to reach the knockout phase of the competition. After three group matches, Tottenham are second in their Champions League group. Spurs have four points, while Crvena Zvezda have three points. Tottenham could head to Serbia without Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. Harry Kane missed last weekendâ€™s 1-1 draw away at Everton due to illness. On the likelihood of Kaneâ€™s return in midweek, the Evening Standard report: Harry Kane faces a fight to recover from a virus in time for the trip to Serbia. Son Heung-min could also miss the match against Red Star Belgrade. Thatâ€™s after the South Koreanâ€™s foul on Andre Gomes resulted in a sickening injury to the Everton midfielder. The Athletic have reported the following on the possibility ofÂ Son Heung-min featuring in the Champions League: Spurs are hopeful that he will be able to travel to Belgrade for their Champions League match against Red Star on Wednesday, but yesterday he was still in the process of managing his emotions from the weekend. He trained as normal on Monday in what was a recovery session after the Everton match, but may yet not be in the right frame of mind for tomorrowâ€™s game. As reported by Spainâ€™s Esport3, Tottenham tried and failed to sign Riqui Puig from Barcelona last summer. Riqui Puig is a 20-year-old central midfielder who is struggling to get minutes in Barcelonaâ€™s first team. Mauricio Pochettino reportedly offered Puig a loan move to Spurs. However, the player rejected Tottenhamâ€™s approach fearing he wouldnâ€™t be able to cement a place in Pochettinoâ€™s XI.   ðŸŽ»#6 A post shared by  R I C A R D P U I G (@riquipuig) on Sep 15, 2019 at 12:44pm PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js In addition, Esport3 claim that Tottenham are tracking Carles Alena. A few days ago, Mundo Deportivo claimed that Barcelona and Carles Alena have agreed that the 21-year-old should leave on loan in January. Itâ€™s unclear, however, whether Alena would opt to move to Spurs. Estadio Deportivo claim that Real Betis, Getafe, Celta Vigo and Granada are all chasing the playerâ€™s signature too.
