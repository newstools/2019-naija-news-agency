Manchester City will go head-to-head with Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday evening as they look to cement their place atop of their Champions League group. Currently, the Citizens have a five-point lead in Group C after amassing 10 points from their opening four ties. 2nd place Shakhtar and 3rd place Dinamo Zagreb have both earned five points so far. So, if the Sky Blues emerge from the Etihad with a victory on Tuesday, they will have qualified for the next stage of the Champions League. And should City beat Shakhtar and 4th place Atalanta either beat or draw with Zagreb, then City will have secured top spot in Group C. //www.instagram.com/embed.js Ahead of the clash with Shakhtar, Pep Guardiola held his pre-match press conference on Monday afternoon. One of the topics discussed in the presser was Sergio Aguero. The Argentine sustained an injury in Man City’s 2-1 win over Chelsea this past weekend. And now Pep has stated that their standout striker will be out for a few games. Guardiola was also unsure if Aguero will be fit for the upcoming Manchester derby: “(Sergio will be out for) a few games – I don’t know exactly.  It will be a few weeks, exactly how many I don’t know. “He has a tendon problem in front –so it will be a few games out. “(Will he be fit for) the derby?I don’t think so, maybe we have a miracle but I don’t think so. “We will miss Sergio, we have had some problems with injuries but we will wait for him and meanwhile we have Gab and Sterling who can play in that position. We will live without him for a while. “There are no other injuries. David (Silva) had cramp (on Saturday) but he’s okay.” As quoted by Manchester City’s official website.
