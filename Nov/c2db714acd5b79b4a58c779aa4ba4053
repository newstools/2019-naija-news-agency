He called out the US embassy in Nigeria and told them to take notes as he was being treated like a respectable person without anyone threatening him with a gun to his head. He wrote,Â  US Embassy in Nigeria, can you see your mate? Free Wifi sef and nobody has a gun to my head to turn off my phone. Our own must be hard sha.
