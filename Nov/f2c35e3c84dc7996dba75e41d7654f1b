Mavin Records, also known as the Supreme Mavin Dynasty (SMD), now has a new operations office and it’s LIT. The new office was unveiled to celebrate Don Jazzy’s 37th birthday. Mavin Records boss, Don Jazzy, shared a video of the new headquarters, and it’s huge! The office is located at Victoria Island, and the record label is home to recording artists such as Korede Bello, Dr SID, D’Prince, Di’Ja, Johnny Drille, Ladipoe, DNA Twins, Rema and Crayon. Don Jazzy, who just clocked 37, is grateful for growth, and he is ensuring all is in order with his business. Sharing photos and videos of the new office, Don Jazzy wrote: All glory to GOD for making me see another year. GOD has been soooo faithful to me. They say a fool at forty is a fool forever so Turning 37 today makes me feel like Jazzy you have only 3 more years to be a fool o lol <img src="https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f602.png?ssl=1" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley amp-wp-843f19c" width="72" height="72"> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f926-1f3fd-200d-2642-fe0f.png?ssl=1" alt="🤦🏽‍♂️" class="wp-smiley amp-wp-843f19c" width="72" height="72">. As I get older I strive to make sure #Allisinorder with my business. So In addition to my birthday celebration, we at Mavin are also unveiling our new creative and corporate spaces. We are happy to move to our new spaces. Mavin Records has grown over the years on the corporate and creative side which influenced the decision to relocate our business to two separate spaces with the corporate space in Victoria Island, Lagos and the creative studios in Lekki, Lagos. The new spaces will help us ensure our teams are happier, further boost productivity and creativity as we continue to execute our growth plans. Thanks for the love and support always.
