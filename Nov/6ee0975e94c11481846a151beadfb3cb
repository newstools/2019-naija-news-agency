The Champions League is set to return to our screens this week. Tottenham’s latest clash in Europe’s most coveted club competition sees them playing host to Greek outfit, Olympiacos. Spurs head into Tuesday’s tie sat 2nd in their Champions League group. 1st spot in Group B is currently occupied by Bayern Munich and it is likely to remain that way once the group stage draws to a close. The German powerhouse have already opened up a five-point lead over Spurs and with just two group games left to play, it is hard to see that gap diminishing too much. In terms of the North London outfit securing 2nd spot in Group B, Spurs are four points ahead of 3rd place Red Star Belgrade. So, a win on Tuesday would see Tottenham secure their place in the next phase of the CL. Spurs should really have no trouble seeing off bottom of the group Olympiacos but it should also be pointed out the only point the Greek side has earned in this season’s Champions League was against Spurs. This tie will also be Jose Mourinho’s first European game as Spurs boss. //www.instagram.com/embed.js Ahead of what should be a fairly routine victory, Tottenham have provided a team news update via Twitter.
