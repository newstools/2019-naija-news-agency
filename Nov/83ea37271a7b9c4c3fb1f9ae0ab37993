The Mirror reported on Monday that the Red Devils are eyeing a transfer swoop for Loader. Loader is also out of contract in June of 2020, meaning he would cost Man United very little, should they try to pursue him this summer. Reading manager Mark Bowen has also spoken about Loader’s contract situation, stating discussions are ongoing: “There are ongoing discussions between the club, him, his agent and his family “He is very happy with his football and yes he wants more game time but he is a great professional, has a smile on his face and works hard. That’s all I can ask for. “He is a confident lad and has got a talent. At times he will be down but he has to be patient and he will get his chance.” As quoted by the Mirror.
