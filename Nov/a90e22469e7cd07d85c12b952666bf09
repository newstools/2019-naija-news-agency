Liverpool take on Man City in a massive Premier League match on Sunday. Liverpool remain unbeaten in the league this season following ten wins and one draw. City, meanwhile, have already lost to Norwich City and Wolves. Prior to Sunday’s match at Anfield, many Liverpool fans are peddling the same ‘joke’. The prediction is that as soon as the Liverpool vs Man City game ends, the FA will confirm that Bernardo Silva will be banned. Silva has been in the dock for several weeks following a tweet regarding Benjamin Mendy. For those of you who missed that Bernardo Silva tweet… pic.twitter.com/5dWCmxNZ33 — Formerly Known as Boo 🎃 (@EldeGuevara) September 22, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Back on October 2, the FA charged Silva: Bernardo Silva has been charged with misconduct for a breach of FA Rule E3 in relation to a social media post on 22 September 2019. It is alleged that the Manchester City player’s activity breaches FA Rule E3(1) as it was insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute. It is further alleged that the activity constitutes an “Aggravated Breach”, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it included reference, whether expressed or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin. On October 9, Silva was given an extension to answer the charge. The Man City midfielder had until October 21 to respond. And what’s happened since? Crickets. The Sun posted the following update on what’s happening with Bernardo Silva’s FA charge two days ago: Bernardo Silva has been kept waiting over a month for an FA independent regulatory commission to crawl to a conclusion for his “Conguitos” tweet. Pretty much everyone felt compelled to put forward their own ideas on a punishment… Everyone, so far, except the FA. So what are the FA waiting for? Cue the conspiracy theories… Evening @FA, I noticed you didn’t reply to my last tweet so I’d like to ask you again… where the fuck has Bernardo Silva’s ban got to then? Cos his extension deadline lapsed over 2 weeks ago now you bunch of corrupt slags. — James Cutler (@cutz10_) November 6, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Just incase you lots forgot.
