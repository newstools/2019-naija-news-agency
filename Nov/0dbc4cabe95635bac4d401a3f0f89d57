As confirmed by the reliable Paul Joyce of the Times, Premier League leaders Liverpool are set for a bizarre 24-hour stretch of action in the middle of December. A potential game of the season candidate was played out at Anfield last week. Liverpool welcomed Arsenal to Merseyside, for a League Cup last-16 clash. Both sides fielded weakened XIs, with their respective focus on matters in the Premier League. This, though, did not take away from the excitement. In fact, the opposite eventually proved to be the case. A 10-goal showpiece, during which Arsenal took the lead on 3 separate occasions, was played out, with Divock Origiâ€™s 93rd-minute equaliser having sent the matchup to a penalty shootout.

Liverpoolâ€™s victory over Arsenal, though, subsequently saw Jurgen Kloppâ€™s men placed in a difficult spot. The League Cup quarter-final fixtures are set to be played out on Tuesday the 17th, and Wednesday the 18th of December. The Reds, however, are set to take part in the Club World Cup in Qatar that week, following their Champions League triumph last season. As such, there had since been speculation that Liverpool could even forfeit their last-8 meeting with Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup, to focus on other competitions deemed more important. But this will not prove the case. As confirmed by Paul Joyce of the Times this evening, incredibly, the Merseysiders will in fact play out both of the aforementioned fixtures within the space of 24 hours: Liverpool to play two teams in two continents in 24-hours. The Carabao Cup quarter-final with Aston Villa will be played on Tuesday, December 17 at the clubâ€™s request. The semi-final of Club World Cup in Qatar on December 18. â€” paul joyce (@_pauljoyce) November 5, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Vitoria Guimaraes vs Arsenal betting tips: Europa League match preview & predictions Atalanta vs Manchester City betting tips: Champions League match preview & predictions Crvena Zvezda vs Tottenham betting tips: Champions League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has today revealed his massive admiration for Arsenal summer signing Gabriel Martinelli.
