John Obi Mikel has this evening aimed a jab at former Chelsea teammate Eden Hazard. Following months of mounting speculation, Zinedine Zidane’s Blancos finally clinched the signing of Chelsea star man Hazard back in June. The Belgian made the move to the Bernabeu for an initial fee of £89 million, despite having had just a year remaining on his contract at Stamford Bridge. 👉 #WelcomeHazard pic.twitter.com/ph6fXHpakp — Real Madrid C.F. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@realmadriden) June 7, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Taking to Facebook on the back of his ‘dream’ transfer being made official, Hazard posted the following message to Chelsea’s fans: ‘Leaving Chelsea is the biggest and toughest decision in my career to date.’ ‘I hope you understand I had to pursue my next chapter, just as each and every one of you should when you have the chance to pursue your dreams.’ ‘Now it’s in the open I would like to put on record one thing was always clear to me, I have loved every moment at Chelsea and not once did I ever consider, nor would I have left for any other club.’ Hazard departed Stamford Bridge widely-regarded as one of the greatest players to ever line out in Chelsea’s colours. Across 352 competitive appearances in the colours of the Blues, the Belgian directly contributed to over 200 goals (stats via Transfermarkt). This included an impressive 16 goals and 15 assists in the Premier League alone last season. While he has long been viewed as one of the finest attacking talents on the planet, however, Hazard’s defensive efforts have been called into question by many over the course of his career. And one of the now-Real Madrid man’s former Chelsea teammates has today taken such criticisms to a new level altogether.
