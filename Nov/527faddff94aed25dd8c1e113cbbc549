Tahith Chong is one of several youngsters to have been given a chance in Manchester United’s first-team under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Chong made his Man United first-team debut back in January of this year, coming off the bench as United saw off Reading in the FA Cup. Along with Chong, Solskjaer, who looks to be favouring a more youthful approach at Old Trafford, has been giving first-team chances to a fair few Man United youth prospects. Take United’s last outing vs Brighton for example. Solskjaer opted to start 19-year-old Brandon Williams at left-back vs the Seagulls. And OGS also had James Garner and Mason Greenwood on the bench with the latter making a sub appearance. As for Chong, he has, in total, made eight appearances for United’s senior side, the last of which came against Newcastle on October 6th.

The electrifying winger’s contract is set to expire in June of 2020. As a result, United would lose him for free in the summer if he didn’t put pen to paper on a new deal. Serie A giants Juventus have previously been linked with a move for Chong. Solskjaer also spoke about both Chong and Angel Gomes, stating he wants them to remain at United: “We’ve had lots of conversations with the boys. “Obviously their contracts run out in the summer but we want them to stay. “I can’t see a better place for a young lad that’s come through the ranks in the academy to play first team football. Both Angel and Chongy have been here for many, many years. “We just want them to continue their development and hopefully they can see that when young lads take their chance, they’ll get more opportunities.” As quoted by the Manchester Evening News. Despite this, Italian outlet Calciomercato have reported that Chong has decided not to renew his contract with Man United.
