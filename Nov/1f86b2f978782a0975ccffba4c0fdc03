On Sunday night, Portugal completed their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a 2-0 away win in Luxembourg. Bruno Fernandes put Portugal ahead in the first half, while Cristiano Ronaldo tapped in a late second. Ronaldo toe-poked the ball over the line from a yard out, denying Wolves striker Diogo Jota his first international goal. However, Ronaldoâ€™s goal lifted him to 99 international goals. Cristiano is now just 10 goals behind Iranâ€™s Ali Daei, who holds the all-time international scoring record (109). We all have a friend who would do thisâ€¦ ðŸ¤¦ .

Oliver Kay pulled out the following stats, while downplaying the amazingness of Ronaldoâ€™s numbers: Luxembourg, Faroe Islands, New Zealand, Lithuania, Andorra and Latvia are, respectively, 96th, 110th, 121st, 132nd, 136th and 143rd in the FIFA rankings. Racking up 23 goals against that lot has been an exercise in flat-track bullying. Of Ronaldoâ€™s 99 international goals, only seven have come in his four World Cups â€“ and none in the knock-out stages. Eight nations (Brazil, Italy, Germany, Uruguay, England, Argentina, France and Spain) have won the World Cup. In 24 matches against those eight heavyweight nations, Ronaldo has scored a grand total of four goals (those three against Spain at the last World Cup, plus one in a friendly against Argentina in 2011). Column on Cristiano Ronaldo and why that incredible strike rate for Portugal â€” 99 goals, 44 of them over the past 4 yrs! â€” feels like an affirmation of international footballâ€™s weakness rather than his greatness, which has been proven irrefutably elsewhere https://t.co/ETrC8DHD0h â€” Oliver Kay (@OliverKay) November 19, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Mundo Deportivo compare Ronaldoâ€™s stats to Leo Messiâ€™s. Of course, while Messi has yet to win a major international tournament in his career, Ronaldo lifted the European Championship with Portugal. Yet, when looking at Ronaldo and Messiâ€™s individual goal contributions, MD suggest that Ronaldoâ€™s numbers are of less quality: Ronaldo has scored 99 goals with Portugal, only 28 of them (29%) have been against teams of the â€˜Top 50â€™ in the world. In the case of Messi, 57 of his 70 goals have been against â€˜Top 50â€™ (82%).
