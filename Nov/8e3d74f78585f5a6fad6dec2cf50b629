A brilliant story surrounding the managerial efforts of Sam Allardyce prior to the then-Blackurn boss’ side being thumped 7-1 by Manchester United has been going viral online today. Back in November of the 2010-11 season, Manchester United welcomed Blackburn to Old Trafford, for a Premier League clash. The hosts were at the peak of their powers, and eventually went on to cruise to the title, with a 9-point edge over closest rivals Chelsea. As such, it came as little surprise when the Red Devils made short work of Blackburn. The extent of their demolition of the Riversiders, though, was likely not predicted by many. United eventually ran out 7-1 winners on the day, with Dimitar Berbatov having stolen the headlines en route to a 5-goal haul. Ji-Sung Park and Nani were also on target for Sir Alex Ferguson’s men, with Christopher Samba’s late strike having proven scant consolation for the embarrassed visitors. As outlined above, meanwhile, United’s drubbing of Blackburn this time 9 years ago has been back in the news today. This comes after former Rovers star Gael Givet opened up on the pre-match talk given by Sam Allardyce, prior to his side’s drubbing. During an interview with L’Equipe, Givet revealed that ‘Big Sam’ attempted to fire his squad up by playing clips from blockbuster films Gladiator and 300. Evidently, though, based on Blackburn’s performance, and the subsequent result, Allardyce’s unusual methods did not produce the desired effect: ‘We were all like, ‘Ahhhhh!’ [mimics soldier with sword]. After 30 minutes, we were 3-0 down. We lost 7-1.’ https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Aston Villa vs Newcastle betting tips: Premier League match preview and predictions Source: Great Goals
