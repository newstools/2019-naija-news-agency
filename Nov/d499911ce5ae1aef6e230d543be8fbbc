Wolves and Aston Villa are currently going head-to-head at Molineux. Wolves began the day 14th in the Premier League but in pretty decent form. Nuno Santo’s side were unbeaten in their previous five PL ties prior to Sunday, including a 2-0 victory over Manchester City. As for Aston Villa, they began the day teetering above the relegation zone in 17th spot. Villa had also lost their last two PL ties before kicking off at Molineux. These two sides had faced off once already during the 2019/20 campaign. Aston Villa and Wolves played at Villa Park on the 30th of October in a League Cup clash. It would be Dean Smith’s side who emerged victorious from said tie, putting Wolves to the sword by two goals to one.

Steer had featured in Villa’s three League Cup ties so far this season but was yet to earn any minutes in the PL.
