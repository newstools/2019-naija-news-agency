The Austrian would provide a team news update in said presser. Hassenhutl confirmed that Stuart Armstrong is not able to play at the weekend. The Southampton boss then provided updates on Sofiane Boufal and Jannik Vestergaard: “We have a few issues. One is Stuart Armstrong, in the last game at the end he cramped a little. He has a few problems with his hamstrings. He isn’t able to play at the weekend. Maybe two weeks he is out – after Newcastle we will look again. “Sofiane Boufal hit his toe, and hasn’t been able to train for three days. It’s a bit swollen still. It will be a little bit difficult for the weekend. “Jannik was ill two days but today has been back in training. That’s the latest news.” As quoted by Southampton’s official website.
