As per a report from the Mirror, German giants Bayern Munich are the latest club to express an interest in out-of-favour Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud. 33-year-old hitman Giroud has been on the books at Stamford Bridge since January of last year. After Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s arrival at Arsenal pushed the Frenchman further down the attacking pecking order of the Gunners, Chelsea swooped to secure Giroud’s signature on deadline day. And the veteran has since gone on to rotate in-and-out of the Blues’ starting XI, amid a number of changes in management. Giroud’s most telling contribution to the Chelsea cause came last season in Europe, when the World Cup winner notched a hugely-impressive 11 goals and 4 assists en route to Europa League glory. ⚽️🥇 2018/19 top scorer… 🔵 Olivier Giroud 😘🏆#UELfinal | @ChelseaFC pic.twitter.com/m2uSE250bO — UEFA Europa League (@EuropaLeague) May 30, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js To this point in the current campaign, though, Giroud has majorly struggled for game-time. New Pensioners boss Frank Lampard has settled firmly on Tammy Abraham as his first-choice centre-forward, with Michy Batshuayi now also ahead of Giroud in the attacking pecking order at Stamford Bridge. This has seen the former Arsenal man notch just a solitary start across all competitions thus far in 2019/20. As such, rumours of late have inevitably seen Giroud linked with a potential exit from Stamford Bridge. The likes of Crystal Palace and Lyon have both been named as possible January destinations for the Frenchman, though the latest reports across Europe have named Serie A giants Inter Milan as Giroud’s most probable destination. And, as per the aforementioned report from the Mirror, another European heavyweight have today joined the Nerazzurri in the hunt for the veteran. The outfit in question are Borussia Dortmund. BVB have previously been linked with a move for Giroud, and are seemingly now ready to reignite their pursuit, following the turn of the year. The striker himself, meanwhile, is said to be in favour of a January departure from Stamford Bridge, as opposed to next summer, to secure regular first-team football ahead of the European Championships.
