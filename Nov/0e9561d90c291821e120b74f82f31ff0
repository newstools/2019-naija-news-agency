Arsenal are set to play host to German outfit Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday evening. The tie will be Arsenal’s penultimate Europa League group game this campaign. The Gunners head into the clash in a fairly dominant position in Group F. Arsenal have a four-point lead opened up between themselves and 2nd place Standard Liege. 3rd place Frankfurt are also four points adrift of Arsenal. So, should the North London outfit emerge victorious on Thursday, they will have secured their place in the next phase of this season’s Europa League.
