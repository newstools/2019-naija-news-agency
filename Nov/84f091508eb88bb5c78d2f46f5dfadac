Tottenham’s last Premier League outing saw them face West Ham on Saturday. The tie was Jose Mourinho’s first in charge of Spurs since replacing Mauricio Pochettino. Mourinho’s stint as Tottenham boss got off to a perfect start as Heung-Min Son put the North London outfit 1-0 up inside 36 minutes. Lucas then doubled the Lilywhites’ lead shortly before the interval. Harry Kane then got in on the action, giving Spurs a commanding three-goal lead in the 49th minute. However, Tottenham’s frailties did begin to show late in the game with West Ham bringing it back to 3-2. Luckily for Spurs, they held out for all three points, earning their first league away win since January. Whilst Spurs will likely be happy at securing a win in Mourinho’s first game, they did suffer one blow on Saturday. Left-back Ben Davies had to be withdrawn 75 minutes into proceedings vs the Hammers. The Welshman then missed Spurs’ 4-2 win over Olympiacos on Tuesday. Now, on Wednesday, Tottenham have provided a fresh update on Davies: Following ongoing examination and assessment over the past few days, we can confirm that Ben Davies sustained ligament damage to his left ankle during Saturday’s win against West Ham United. Assessment continues to determine whether surgery is required with the Wales international defender expected to undergo an extended period of rehabilitation. https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js See also: Braga vs Wolves betting tips: UEFA Europa League match preview and predictions Celtic vs Stade Rennais betting tips: UEFA Europa League match preview and predictions Source: Great Goals
