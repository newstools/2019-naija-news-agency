Arsenal’s latest clash saw them take on highflying Leicester City in Saturday’s late Premier League kick-off. The Gunners headed into the tie in fairly dismal form. The North London outfit were winless in their previous three league outings prior to kicking off at the King Power. And their lackluster performances once again continued vs the Foxes with Jamie Vardy and James Maddison striking as Leicester emerged with a 2-0 victory. After going four league ties without a single win, Arsenal’s top-four hopes look to be deteriorating with each passing week. They are now down to 6th in the English top-flight and a staggering eight points adrift of 4th place Manchester City. With Arsenal currently on course for another season of outside of the Champions League, you may think Unai Emery’s days in North London are numbered. However, for the moment, the Spaniard looks to be getting some time to prove his worth. According to the Evening Standard, while concern is said to be growing over elements of Emery’s management, Arsenal are determined to give the former PSG man time to turn things around. The report from the Standard also cities Arsenal’s next six games as an opportunity to fix the current decline: One report over the weekend suggesting Arsenal’s head of football, Raul Sanllehi, had met Luis Enrique to discuss the possibility of replacing Emery was privately dismissed and the club’s next six matches are seen as an opportunity to arrest the present decline. Arsenal’s next six games are against Southampton (PL), Eintracht Frankfurt (Europa League), Norwich(PL), Brighton (PL), West Ham (PL) and Standard Liege (EL).
