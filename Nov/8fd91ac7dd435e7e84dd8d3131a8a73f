Niger State Ministry of Women Affairs, in collaboration with Raise Foundation and WRAPA, is kicking against gender based violence. Men and women came out enmasse in one voice to commemorate the annual 16 days of activism, taking to the streets with banners. 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence is an international campaign to challenge violence against women and girls. The campaign runs every year from 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10 December, Human Rights Day. Raise Foundation shared photos on Instagram from the peace protest, and wrote: In Partnership with the #nigerstate Ministry of Women Affairs and @wrapang we took to the streets to walk against gender violence.
The #16Days of activism is a time to act for a world where women and girls can live free of fear of violence in all forms. Everyday should be a day of #Activism #AgainstGBV”.
