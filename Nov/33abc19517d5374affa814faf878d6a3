Shooting her shot, @KateAustin_ on Twitter had shared that her parents have refused to attend her wedding because they don’t like that she’s gay. She mentioned her two favourite celebrities, Ellen Degeneres and Chrissy Teigen, asking if they would do her the honour instead. hi @chrissyteigen & @TheEllenShow!! my parents aren’t going to attend my wedding because they don’t like that i’m gay! i need someone to walk me down the aisle and someone else for a “father/daughter” dance. plz come, my fiancée and i would cry 💕 #shootingmyshot pic.twitter.com/DGcH2KQq5f — kate austin (@KateAustin_) November 5, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Well her shot scored!
