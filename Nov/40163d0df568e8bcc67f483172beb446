It‚Äôs been a tough start to the season for Tottenham. Spurs are 14th in the Premier League with 14 points from 12 matches. This Saturday, West Ham host Tottenham in the league. What will happen if Spurs lose away at the Hammers? A few days ago, Telegraph reporter Matt Law suggested the West Ham match could be Mauricio Pochettino‚Äôs last game in the Spurs dugout: The West Ham United game immediately after the international break is now rated as make or break for Tottenham‚Äôs campaign, and could even prove decisive for the manager himself. On Tuesday, the Times double down on suggestions that Pochettino‚Äôs days at Tottenham could soon be over: Pochettino‚Äôs future has been called into question by poor results and friction with the board over the club‚Äôs transfer policy. There is concern that Pochettino may feel that the time is right to move to a bigger club, having previously rejected such opportunities. There is a growing belief at the club that it is a question of when and not if he will depart, with the summer being the most likely time that the Argentinian will leave. Tottenham Hotspur are considering the RB Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann as a potential replacement for Mauricio Pochettino should he leave the club.

The topics of the discussion have been ‚Äúthe manager‚Äôs present situation and the upcoming transfer window.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Telegraph today label the Levy-Pochettino sitdown as ‚Äúcrisis talks‚Äù, reporting: Mauricio Pochettino has held talks with chairman Daniel Levy over his Tottenham Hotspur future as players at the club brace themselves for a managerial change. But is this really evidence that supports the claim Pochettino is heading towards the Tottenham exit door? Arguably, if Pochettino is planning for future transfer windows, isn‚Äôt this evidence that the Argentine is expecting to remain in north London? Moreover, at the start of October, Pochettino publicly stated he wouldn‚Äôt walk away from Tottenham.   ‚ÄúThis is the moment to stay altogether!‚Äù üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . .Mauricio Pochettino insists he will NOT walk away from @spursofficial ‚ö™Ô∏è . . . . . . . . . . .#spurs #tottenham #football #premierleague #pochettino A post shared by  HaytersTV (@hayterstv) on Oct 4, 2019 at 5:37am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js It‚Äôs also worth noting that Pochettino is under contract at Tottenham until 2023. Moreover, the Telegraph recently revealed that Spurs would have to pay the Argentine a significant sum if they axe him: Sources (claim) it would cost chairman Daniel Levy around ¬£12.5‚Äâmillion to sack him. (Daniel) Levy would prefer not to pay an expensive compensation bill to sack a manager who has done so much for the club.

Claims that Nagelsmann could join Spurs have been circling for several weeks, and Nagelsmann‚Äôs name is mentioned by both the Times and Telegraph today. The Times report: Spurs have tried to find the best young managers and the club have been tracking Nagelsmann‚Äôs progress with Leipzig and Hoffenheim in recent seasons. However, the Times also believe that Tottenham may have to battle Man United to land Nagelsmann: Nagelsmann‚Äôs contract with Leipzig runs until 2023 and Manchester United are tracking the German.

Rodgers is under contract at the King Power Stadium until 2022. However, the Times link Rodgers to the Lillywhites. Readers are told: Tottenham retain admiration for Brendan Rodgers, the Leicester City manager who declined their offer to replace Harry Redknapp in 2012. In total, six managers are linked to Spurs in today‚Äôs Times and Telegraph. The Telegraph survey the possible candidates, revealing: Jose Mourinho and Max Allegri are out of work, while Carlo Ancelotti‚Äôs position at Napoli is uncertain. Managers who would be more difficult to appoint mid-season and may interest Tottenham are Bournemouth‚Äôs Eddie Howe and Red Bull Leipzig‚Äôs Julian Nagelsmann.
