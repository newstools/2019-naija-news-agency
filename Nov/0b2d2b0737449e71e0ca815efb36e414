The latest reports across the English media this evening suggest that Arsenalâ€™s staff are waiting for Unai Emeryâ€™s sacking to be made official. Emeryâ€™s Gunners welcomed Southampton to the Emirates this past weekend, for a Premier League clash. The north Londoners headed into proceedings amid a dreadful run of form. In the buildup to the international break, Arsenal had failed to pick up a victory in any of their last 5 outings across all competitions. And, when all was said and done in the English capital on Saturday, the hosts again failed to get the job done. Despite Alexandre Lacazetteâ€™s double, Arsenal only managed to pick up a point, following another disjointed display. The Gunnersâ€™ latest sub-par showing, meanwhile, has since seen further pressure heaped on the shoulders of the under-fire Unai Emery. The Spaniard has been hotly-tipped to be the 2nd managerial casualty in north London in the space of a week, with the likes of Mikel Arteta and Max Allegri touted as potential replacements. And, as per a report from Goal.comâ€™s Arsenal expert Charles Watts this evening, it appears as though Emery being relieved of his duties is now viewed as more of a case of â€˜when, and not ifâ€™ by those within the club. The Gunnersâ€™ staff have reportedly already prepped themselves for the tacticianâ€™s sacking, with decisive action â€˜expectedâ€™ to be taken imminently. Thereâ€™s a growing sense behind the scenes at Arsenal that itâ€™s a case of when and not if Emery is sacked â€“ club staff are just waiting for the news to come.
