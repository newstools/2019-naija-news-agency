From releasing a grammy nominated album to having sold-out concerts across the world, the musician can truly be called the “African Giant”. The singer was nominated in two categories, Prize for Young Person of The Year and Prize for Music category. He, however, emerged the winner of both awards and in the Prize for Music category, he competed with other nominees like Teni, Falz, Johnny Drille and Wurld. //www.instagram.com/embed.js The post Burna Boy Bags Two Awards At 2019 Future Awards Ceremony appeared first on tooXclusive.
