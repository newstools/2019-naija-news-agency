The 330-acre Tyler Perry Studios, which recently celebrated its grand opening, was built on the grounds of Fort McPherson, a former military base in Atlanta, and is one of the largest production facilities in the country. There are 12 state-of-the-art soundstages (each named after an African American trailblazer in the entertainment industry), 200 acres of green space, and a dazzling back lot of sets that. In addition to the presidential mansion, includes a bank, county jail, lakeside cabin, trailer park, suburban homes, and a commercial jet.
