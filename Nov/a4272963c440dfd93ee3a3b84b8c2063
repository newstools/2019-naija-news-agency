Liverpool’s win over Brighton this afternoon came at a cost, as the Reds lost first-choice shot-stopper Alisson to suspension. Jurgen Klopp’s men welcomed the Seagulls to Anfield a short time ago, for a Premier League clash. The hosts headed into proceedings sitting pretty atop the English top-flight table. In addition, after Manchester City stuttered to a 2-2 draw at Newcastle earlier this afternoon, Liverpool were aware that a win over Brighton would see them open up a hefty 11-point advantage over the champions. And, when all was said and done, secure yet another 3 points was precisely what the Merseysiders managed. A first-half double from Virgil van Dijk eventually proved telling, as Lewis Dunk’s late free-kick in the end proved little more than a consolation for visitors Brighton. https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js However, it was not all positive news for Liverpool at Anfield this afternoon. Dunk’s strike, 10 minutes from time, came after a change between the posts for the Reds. After a lofted ball over the top of the hosts’ backline set Leandro Trossard free, the Brighton substitute attempted to lob the onrushing Alisson. In a moment of madness, Liverpool’s no.1, though, opted to block Trossard’s effort with his hand, despite having been well outside his box. As such, following a VAR review, Alisson was deservedly given his marching orders by referee Martin Atkinson. And this rush of blood on the part of the former Roma man has proven costly for the European champions. Alisson’s dismissal is set to see the shot-stopper suspended for one match, which just so happens to come in the form of a Merseyside derby meeting with Everton in 4 days’ time. https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Impressive stat highlights quality of Liverpool defenders Virgil van Dijk & Alexander-Arnold Jonjo Shelvey reacts to crucial equaliser vs Man City: ‘I might be a hero in Liverpool now’ Source: Great Goals
