Jose Mourinho’s Champions League bow on the Tottenham bench this evening has seen the Portuguese tactician become the owner of a new record. Mourinho’s Spurs are currently locked in action with Olympiacos in north London. The clash comes as the capital giants’ 2nd since last week’s high-profile change on the club’s bench. The first fixture of the Mourinho era, on Saturday at West Ham, saw Tottenham run out eventual 3-2 winners. Another victory in their meeting with Greek powerhouse Olympiacos tonight, meanwhile, would see the Lilywhites book their spot in the last-16 of the Champions League. The early exchanges at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, however, have since not gone at all according to plan.

No matter the eventual result tonight, though, Spurs boss Jose Mourinho will depart his side’s ground in the knowledge that he has etched his name indelibly into the history books of the Premier League. In overseeing Spurs’ latest European outing, the Portuguese has become the first-ever manager to take charge of three different English clubs in the Champions League. This of course comes after Mourinho guided both Chelsea and Manchester United through campaigns in club football’s elite cup competition: https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Liverpool vs Napoli betting tips: Champions League preview & predictions Valencia vs Chelsea betting tips: Champions League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
