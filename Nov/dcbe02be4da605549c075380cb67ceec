Crystal Palace had a decent start to the 2019/20 campaign and after around 10 Premier League games had been played, the Eagles were in and around the top six. However, Palaceâ€™s form has slowly begun to decline in recent weeks. Roy Hodgsonâ€™s men have failed to win any of their last four PL outings, losing three of those ties. Part of the reason for Crystal Palaceâ€™s decline recently could be attributed to their lack of goals. Palace have, in their opening 12 PL outings this term, found the back of the net on just 10 occasions. Only Watford, who have won just one league game this season, have scored less than Palace. Crystal Palaceâ€™s lack of goals may have something to do with Wilfried Zahaâ€™s poor start to the campaign. The Ivorian netted 10 and provided 10 assists in 34 league fixtures last season. However, Zaha has yet to open his account for Palace in 2019/20.   All about the mental attitude ðŸ’­ A post shared by @ wilfriedzaha on Nov 7, 2019 at 9:22am PST //www.instagram.com/embed.js With their main talisman underperforming, Palace are apparently looking elsewhere for goals. According to the Sun, Crystal Palace are lining up a Â£20m January transfer swoop for Celtic forward, Odsonne Edouard. Palace are said to have money to spend in the upcoming transfer window thanks to the Â£50m they earned from Aaron Wan-Bissakaâ€™s move to Manchester United, as per the Sun. Edouard, who joined Celtic from Ligue 1 giants PSG on a permanent basis in July of 2018, has racked up 105 appearances across all competitions for the Scottish champions. In those 105 ties, Edouard has scored 45 and assisted 24. The 21-year-old has also had a bright start to the current campaign, netting 12 and assisting 12 in 24 games for Celtic.
