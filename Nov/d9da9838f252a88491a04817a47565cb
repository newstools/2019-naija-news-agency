We did the video just for him…It’s hard trying to do music and schooling but we’ve found a way to blend it, like after school, we do the basics and before school, we take our books to read… I got an advice from my mother that education is first and yea, we put it first but we’re good in the music and we believe in ourselves because our success is surprising you This video is causing serious conversation on the internet as many express their surprise at how far Rema has been working hard contrary to their opinion that he’s just a talented kid D’Prince brought from Benin.
