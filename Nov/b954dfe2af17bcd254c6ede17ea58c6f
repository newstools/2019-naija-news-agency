 Dirisu Yakubu – Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said on Thursday the All Progressives Congress (APC) has no place in the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa State following the disqualification of its candidate, David Lyon, and his running mate, by two courts of competent jurisdiction. The party noted that the development points to nothing but victory for democracy, stressing that manipulators “cannot continue to have their way in our electoral process.” In a statement signed by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party also tasked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately delist the APC from the ballot as “any vote cast for that party would be a wasted vote, since the court judgments have made it clear that the APC is not in the election.” The PDP also reminded the INEC that two decisions of courts of competent jurisdiction have negated the participation of the APC in the race.
