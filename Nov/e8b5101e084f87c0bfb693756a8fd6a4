  Davido – “Intro (Vanity) Lyrics“  Omo na vanity
Omo na vanity Omo na vanity
Kiddo
Kiddo Everything I do is a life style o
I say make I use my diplomacy
Eh
But people too like hypocrisy
My Diamonds and my cars na freestyle o I’m a shooting star in a blockbuster
I’m a young stunner
I’m a stock broker
So many haters on my Instagram
On my Twitter so many foes
I’m a shooting star in a blockbuster
I’m a young stunner
Freedom fighter
So many haters on my Instagram
On my Twitter so many foes Jah be my savior, on God
Bad man keep me on guard
Jah be my savior on God
Bad man keep me on guard
Jah be my savior on God
Bad man keep me on guard
Jah be my savior on God
Bad man keep me on guard
Jah be my savior on God
Bad man keep me on guard New broom go sweep better
Eta bela si ijoba wa
From Umbrella to the broom
Gbagbe adafa, Agbada alefa
Eyan mile mefa
Kilode tan suffer New broom go sweep better
Them tori us propaganda from January to December
We no gbadun nepa
So all of our youths wan go America Baba tete shey o
Ki o dami lohun ayo

Ki o segun funmi ayo I’m a shooting star in a blockbuster

On my Twitter so many foes
I’m a shooting star in a blockbuster
I’m a young stunner
Freedom fighter
So many haters on my Instagram
On my Twitter so many foes Jah be my saviour on God
