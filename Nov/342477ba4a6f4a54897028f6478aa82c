While many West Ham fans may want Manuel Pellegrini gone, the Chilean doesn’t appear to be on his way out of the London Stadium anytime soon. The BBC have reported on Monday that West Ham have no intention of sacking Pellegrini: West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini will be given the chance to turn round the club’s alarming slump in form. Manuel Pellegrini will be given more time at West Ham, despite their slump in form. The club has had a terrible run of results, seeing them slide from top six contenders to the edge of a relegation battle.

However, it’s been a horrible recent run of results for Pellegrini, as West Ham are winless in seven games. Last weekend, Burnley beat the Hammers 3-0 at Turf Moor. That result has left them fifth from bottom with 13 points from 12 matches. West Ham should be doing a lot better. The Hammers spent more than 120 million pounds in the summer recruiting players like Sebastien Haller and Pablo Fornals. However, a few factors are helping Pellegrini avoid the blame right now. Firstly, Lucasz Fabianski’s torn hip muscle injury is cited as a big reason for West Ham’s downturn in form. Secondly, when it comes to West Ham’s recruitment, Pellegrini isn’t in the hot seat. The BBC report: While it is accepted Pellegrini bears some responsibility for the current mess, more attention is being placed on the work of sporting director Mario Husillos, who arrived at West Ham with the Chilean in the summer of 2018. Times reporter Ian Whittell has also picked out Husillos as a problematic figure at West Ham. While Husillos may also retain his job for now, his role could be limited. The Times reveal: The summer transfer work of Husillos… remains an unconvincing work in progress. Reports suggest that… Husillos may have limited influence in the January transfer window. Meanwhile Pellegrini, who recommended Husillos for the post, is understood to be under no short-term threat. Well I have mixed news. Those close to the board are saying they have no intention of sacking him and he will be in charge for next couple of games at least, those close to Pellegrini do not think he has long left. Either way I’m convinced he will be the manager against Spurs https://t.co/SRy3LQQHkI — ExWHUemployee (@ExWHUemployee) November 10, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Roberto is West Ham’s goalie following Fabianski’s injury. However, Roberto has impressed few after conceding 13 goals in six matches. That included conceding four goals at Oxford in the cup, plus three at home to Newcastle in the Premier League. In the Athletic on Monday, David Ornstein says West Ham are considering signing a keeper in January: With Fabianski ruled out until late December, manager Manuel Pellegrini has refused to speak critically of Roberto’s performances but The Athletic understands West Ham are working behind the scenes to sign a new goalkeeper during the January transfer window. It may be all the more frustrating for supporters to learn that, according to my colleague Adam Crafton, the club had a chance to sign Cardiff City goalkeeper Neil Etheridge last summer but turned it down because they were satisfied that Roberto was the best option.
