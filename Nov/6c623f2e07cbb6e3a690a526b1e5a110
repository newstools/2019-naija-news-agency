Manchester Unitedâ€™s meeting with FK Partizan this evening saw one major positive taken away from proceedings for the Red Devils, in the form of the superb link-up play between Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâ€™s men welcomed Serbian giants Partizan to Old Trafford a short time ago, for their latest Europa League outing. The hosts headed into proceedings having been ousted from their spot atop the Group L table earlier today, following AZ Alkmaarâ€™s thumping of Astana. As such, United no doubt entered this eveningâ€™s matchup with their sights firmly set on reestablishing themselves as group leaders. And, when all was said and done in Manchester, the English giants managed just that, in some style. A creative, attack-minded display eventually saw United run out convincing 3-0 victors. Youngster Mason Greenwood set the home side on their way with 20 minutes on the clock, latching onto Marcus Rashfordâ€™s through ball before cutting inside and lashing home in confident fashion.

And Marcus Rashford rounded out the gameâ€™s scoring shortly after the interval, rifling a fantastic finish into the roof of the Partizan net with his left foot. As such, Manchester United have moved back to the top of the Europa League Group L table, with 10 points from 4 games. All told, tonight proved a genuine 90 minutesâ€™ work to be proud of for the Red Devils. The Old Trafford powerhouse looked dangerous throughout proceedings, performing with a vigour and attacking intent that has been sorely missing from their play for essentially the entire campaign to this point. While some will no doubt argue that it came against a rather lacklustre Partizan side, the fact is that United could only put to the sword the side that were in front of them. Besides, the hosts have struggled majorly against poor sides already over the early months of the season, with their displays against the likes of Astana, Rochdale and even their opponents this evening two weeks ago, having all proven thoroughly sub-par. Amongst the many positives to have been taken from tonight, though, one that many fans of the Red Devils will no doubt be most pleased about was the link-up play between Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer opted for an exciting, pacy front-3 of Rashford, Martial and Mason Greenwood versus Partizan. And, while 18-year-old Greenwood impressed once again on the right with his latest composed display, it was the explosive and, crucially, fruitful partnership between Unitedâ€™s more-established attackers which lit up Old Trafford during their hour+ on the pitch together.

There appears no doubt at this point that Rashford is simply a better player when fielded on the left, with his at-times questionable finishing less of an issue when he is also given the freedom to wreak havoc and create with his seering pace along the wing. The English internationalâ€™s bursts inside towards the edge of the Partizan box were time and time again rewarded over the opening 45 minutes, as he dipped between the lines of the away sideâ€™s midfield and defence whilst playing off partner in crime Martial. Significantly, the performances of both players were also not without substance, as Unitedâ€™s first-choice front-2 each managed to find the net in style.

The early signs, though, look very, very positive.
