The “Doc Shebeleza” rapper took to his Twitter page some hours ago to reveal there is nothing glamorous about being an entrepreneur. He reveals it is time wasting and really stressful when one is not doing what he or she wants. He said people should not be fooled with the encouragement of entrepreneurship as it is not worth it. Casper wrote; “Don’t let them fool you. Being an entrepreneur is not glamorous. You spend half of the time stressing and fighting. If you are not doing something you absolutely love, you will fail.” Don’t let them fool you. Being an entrepreneur is not glamorous. You spend half of the time stressing and fighting. If you are not doing something you absolutely love, you will fail. — R.M Phoolo (@casspernyovest) November 7, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js  The post There Is Nothing Good About Being An Entrepreneur, It’s Stressful & Time Wasting – SA Rapper; Cassper Nyovest appeared first on tooXclusive.
