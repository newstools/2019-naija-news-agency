As per a report from the reliable Juanfe Sanz Perez of Spanish outlet El Chiringuito, Barcelona are expressing a serious interest in the signing of Arsenal star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Gabonese hitman Aubameyang made the move to north London from Borussia Dortmund in January of last year. And to say that the 30-year-old has since gone on to prove himself a hit would be putting it lightly. All told, across 78 appearances in the red of Arsenal, Aubameyang has found the net a hugely-impressive 50 times, marking a ratio of just under 2 goals every 3 games. In fact, his 50th-strike for the Gunners, which came last weekend versus Wolves, saw ‘Auba’ etch his name into the history books of the capital giants: 🇬🇦 @Aubameyang7 for @Arsenal: 🏟 78 Games

After Unai Emery announced that Granit Xhaka had been stripped of the club’s captaincy, the Spanish tactician opted to name Aubameyang as his side’s new leader.

It has been suggested that La Liga champions Barcelona have set their sights firmly on Aubameyang’s signature. The African is reportedly viewed as an ideal replacement for the aging Luis Suarez at the Camp Nou. The Blaugrana’s interest in Auba is labelled as ‘very’ real, with Perez having gone as far as to suggest that the Catalan giants could move for Arsenal’s captain as soon as January. 🚨¡EXCLUSIVA de @JuanfeSanzPerez!🚨 “El BARÇA está MUY INTERESADO en AUBAMEYANG”.#ChiringuitoBarcelona pic.twitter.com/CCFvhfkITM — El Chiringuito TV (@elchiringuitotv) November 7, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Liverpool vs Manchester City free bets & enhanced betting offers Leicester City vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League match preview and predictions Southampton vs Everton betting tips: Premier League preview & prediction Source: Great Goals James Benge of football.london has provided an update on Arsenal’s attempts to secure the long-term futures of star attackers Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette.
