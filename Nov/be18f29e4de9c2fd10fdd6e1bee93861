Liverpool and Manchester City are set to go head-to-head on Sunday in what should be an enthralling clash. The Merseyside powerhouse currently sit top of the Premier League and are unbeaten in their opening 11 league ties this campaign. This has opened up a six-point gap between Liverpool and 2nd place, Manchester City. Unlike Liverpool, City have already been dealt two defeats in the PL this season. And should they emerge from Anfield without a single point, the Citizens would then have a nine-point gap to overturn atop of the English top-flight.   #LIVMCI fast approaching! #LFC #LiverpoolFC #Liverpool #PL #PremierLeague #Anfield A post shared by  Liverpool Football Club (@liverpoolfc) on Nov 9, 2019 at 1:52am PST //www.instagram.com/embed.js Ahead of the crunch clash with City, Jurgen Klopp spoke to the media on Friday. One topic discussed was PSG and France forward, Kylian Mbappe. Mbappe has been linked with a move to the European Champions recently. However, when speaking about the wonderkid, Klopp stated there is no chance Liverpool can sign him: “Buying this calibre of player is difficult. I don’t see any club at the moment who can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG. “I don’t see any club; that is how it is. And we are involved in the clubs that cannot do it. It is as easy as that. “OK, from a sporting point of view, there are not a lot of reasons to not sign him. What a player he is. “But it is about the money, of course. No chance. Absolutely no chance. Sorry for killing that story!” As quoted by Sky Sports News.
