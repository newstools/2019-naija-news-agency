Reliable Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano has this afternoon assured that former Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri is not amongst the candidates to replace Unai Emery at Arsenal. The news that Gunners fans across the globe had been waiting for finally arrived this morning. A Europa League group stage defeat at the hands of Eintracht Frankfurt last night proved the straw that broke the camel’s back when it came to Unai Emery’s time in charge at the Emirates, as the Spaniard was officially relieved of his duties by the Arsenal hierarchy: ‘We announce today that the decision has been taken to part company with our head coach Unai Emery and his coaching team.’ ‘The decision has been taken due to results and performances not being at the level required.’ https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Club legend Freddie Ljungberg, meanwhile, has since been handed the role of interim boss in north London. https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Arsenal’s statement this morning, though, also confirmed that ‘the search for a new head coach is underway’, suggesting Swedish tactician Ljungberg is not viewed as a potential answer to the club’s long-standing problems in the dugout. As a result, a number of high-profile managerial targets have already been touted in the media over the hours since Emery’s sacking. The likes of Nuno Espirito Santo, Mikel Arteta, Carlo Ancelotti and Max Allegri have been named as possible successors to the Spaniard at the Emirates. If the latest update courtesy of the reliable Fabrizio Romano is anything to go by, though, then the latter of these tacticians will absolutely not be leading Arsenal forward at any point in the near future. An exchange on Twitter a short time ago saw Romano claim, in no uncertain terms, that former AC Milan and Juventus boss Allegri is not in the running for the Gunners’ vacant managerial post: https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Liverpool vs Brighton betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Tottenham vs Bournemouth betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Chelsea vs West Ham betting tips: Premier League match preview and predictions Newcastle United vs Manchester City betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
