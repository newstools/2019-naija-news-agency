Luis Suarez spent around three and a half years with Liverpool. The Uruguayan joined the Merseyside powerhouse from Ajax for a fee believed to be around £23.85m. During his stint with Liverpool, Suarez cemented himself as one of the top forwards in the Premier League and perhaps even Europe. Suarez bagged 82 and assisted 47 in 133 games across all competitions for the Reds with his 2013/14 campaign particularly impressive. In 33 league outings for Liverpool that season, the now 32-year-old netted 31 and provided 17 assists as Liverpool came within touching distance of the Premier League title.

The now Liverpool captain has since opened up on his experience with Suarez and why he ‘wanted to kill him’. Henderson recalled an incident in training, in which he felt hurt by some of Suarez’s gestures and after the now Barcelona man had done it a few times, Henderson claims he exploded and was ready to kill Suarez: “I was trying to do the best I can do. Being a footballer, there is criticism and people doubting you all the time. “At that time, I was a young player and there were one or two things Luis did in training that I didn’t like. “It made me feel I wasn’t good enough to be in the same team in training. “The arms were up like ‘what the f***, what is he doing’, like I shouldn’t be there. “That really hurt me. He did it three times and then I exploded and I was ready to kill him. “From that point, I had a good relationship with Luis. The next game I set him up for his goal. “He was brilliant with me after that and I was really close to him after that and he was another big player I learned from.” As quoted by the Mirror.
