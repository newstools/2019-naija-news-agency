The Beatz Awards 2019 held its 5th edition at the Shell Hall, Muson Centre, on Sunday, attracting top music professionals from across the country. The award event was hosted by popular musician Dr. Sid, and the crowd was thrilled by amazing performances from Johnny Drille and top comedians like Emmaohmygod, Deeone, Omobaba. Thanks to our ever-lovely BNers, we won in this year’s “Best Blog!” (As we did last year.) We’re truly, truly grateful to you guys, and to Beatz Awards, too. One major highlight of the show was the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award to Don Jazzy. The legendary producer was honoured for his contribution to the music industry, and had an award category renamed after him. The New Discovery Producer category will now be called the ‘Don Jazzy New Discovery Producer’. In his humble and generous nature, Don Jazzy added a twist to the category by adding N1million cash prize for the winner from next year. One of the biggest winners of the night was music producer Kel P Vibes, who bagged three awards on the night, closely followed by Johnny Drille. Here’s a complete list of winners.
