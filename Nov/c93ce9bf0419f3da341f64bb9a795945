Virgil van Dijk made the switch to Liverpool from Southampton in January of 2018. Since joining the Merseyside powerhouse, van Dijk’s rise to one of the best defenders in Europe has been dramatic. The Dutchman helped transform a previously shaky Liverpool backline into one of the tightest in the Premier League. Liverpool conceded just 22 goals in 38 PL outings last term, the lowest in the league. Liverpool have also reached two Champions League finals since VVD joined them, including the 2019 CL final, which they won. The Reds also earned an emphatic 97 points in the Premier League last campaign.   Going in to the international break with a big win against a top City side! #YNWA A post shared by  Virgil van Dijk (@virgilvandijk) on Nov 11, 2019 at 6:12am PST //www.instagram.com/embed.js After having such an exemplary spell with Liverpool, van Dijk has already accumulated a number of awards, including the UEFA Men’s Player of the Year and the Premier League Player of the Season. Van Dijk has also recently been named on the 30-man shortlist for the 2019 Ballon d’Or award. With the winner of one of the most coveted prizes in football set to be announced next month, Danny Murphy has backed Virgil van Dijk to take home the Ballon d’Or: “For me, the winner is obvious: Virgil van Dijk. “I believe that because of the massive impact he’s had on Liverpool Football Club. “There are so many facets to him: his leadership qualities have grown, and his influence on others is probably the biggest reason. “His impact on the performances of the players around him, especially the back four, is phenomenal.” As quoted by Goal. However, Murphy also conceded that if Lionel Messi won the award, it would be understandable: “Obviously, you’re dealing with the best players in the world and when you look at Lionel Messi’s goalscoring record, if he did win it over Van Dijk, you would have to understand why.” As quoted by Goal.
