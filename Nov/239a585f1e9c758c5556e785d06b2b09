Solskjaer was drawn into a comment about how Premier League footballers should engage with social media. The Man United manager revealed his dated belief that footballers shouldn’t be on social media. Solskjaer said: Sometimes it seems because you’re a footballer, you can experience many different things. It should be the contrary — you should be boring. You go to bed, you rest, you recover and you get ready for the next game. You can do all the other stuff after your career has finished. You don’t have to read social media, you don’t have to be using it. Sometimes you do good, some of these boys are fantastic, because we’re role models. For young boys to see these boys doing football stuff is brilliant… all the other stuff? No.   Looking for which shoe to wear.
