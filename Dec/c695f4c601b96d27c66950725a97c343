Police brutality knows no status. We are on our way to Panti. First of all, the cars of the customers were towed and seized for violating traffic. FINE. But they were arrested and told to pay N100,000 bribe. Why one earth do you need to pay the police a bribe after your car has already been seized. You arrest those parked on the road. Someone goes to bail the people arrested. You arrest the person to.
