Leicester City boss Brendan Rodgers has this evening provided an update on the respective availabilities of Jamie Vardy and Ricardo Pereira, for his side’s meeting with Newcastle United. The Foxes visited West Ham on Saturday evening, for their latest Premier League outing. Leicester headed into proceedings hoping to get back to winning ways, after falling to consecutive defeats at the hands of Manchester City and Liverpool over the festive period. And, when all was said and done in the English capital, get back on track was precisely what Brendan Rodgers’ men managed. Goals from Kelechi Iheanacho and Demarai Gray eventually proved the difference between the sides, as Leicester maintained their 1-point advantage over 3rd-placed Man City in the English top-flight. Leicester’s victory at the London Stadium came despite a whole host of changes to the club’s starting XI. Kasper Schmeichel and Jonny Evans were the only two players to have maintained their places from the Foxes line-up that fell to Liverpool two days prior. Leicester City make 9(!) changes from the team beaten 4-0 by Liverpool on Boxing Day. Only Kasper Schmeichel and Jonny Evans survive. 😱 pic.twitter.com/utqb2M9DyQ — Squawka Football (@Squawka) December 28, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As showcased above, two of those to have missed out on Leicester’s latest victory were Jamie Vardy and Ricardo Pereira. Premier League top-scorer Vardy was absent due to his wife giving birth over the weekend, while full-back Pereira was given the night off after picking up a hamstring problem. Brendan Rodgers, though, has this evening confirmed that both are set to return to the fold for Leicester’s upcoming meeting with Newcastle. Speaking during a press conference a short time ago, the Foxes boss first provided the following update on Pereira’s fitness: ‘He should be fine for Newcastle. He just felt it a bit tight, so I didn’t take him to West Ham. I gave him a rest, but he’ll be back in and fine for Wednesday.’ On Vardy, meanwhile, Rodgers continued: ‘He had the good news on Saturday and, to be fair to him, he delayed this as long as he possibly could! But his wife went into hospital on Friday and gave birth on Saturday morning.’ ‘It’s brilliant for both of them. He wouldn’t have played on Saturday anyway. He’d have been on the bench. But we let him stay at home to look after his wife and kids and he’ll be back for Newcastle.’ Brendan Rodgers talks fitness news ahead of #NewLei ⤵️ https://t.co/7FODYML1K0 — Leicester City (@LCFC) December 30, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The latest on Chelsea & Man United’s Jadon Sancho pursuits Mino Raiola speaks out over Paul Pogba’s plans for January: ‘We are good with United’ Source: Great Goals
