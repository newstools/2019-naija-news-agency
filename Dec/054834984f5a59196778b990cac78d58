Kiddblack ft. Kwesi Arthur – Dirty Diana  Ghanaian rapper Kiddblack presents the release of his brand new single. The song is titled “Dirty Diana”, a mid-tempo fusion of dancehall and afrobeats. On this one, the rapper and La Meme Gang member details a sensual adult encounter between him and his “Dirty Diana”. “Dirty Diana” is a collaboration between Kiddblack and Ground Up rap superstar Kwesi Arthur, who laces the song with a melodious and catchy hook. Kidd’s clear cut singing and baritone rap vocals complements Kwesi’s floaty rap-sung melodies, as they sing the praises of a woman who’s promiscuous, but very much to their pleasure. The song was produced by Boye ‘The Genius’. “I wanna sing songs of praise/she wanna sit on my face”  DOWNLOAD AUDIO   The post Kiddblack ft.
