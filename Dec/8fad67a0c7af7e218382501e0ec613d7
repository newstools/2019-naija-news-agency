Samklef accused the “Fever” singer of always belittling him during interviews. He spilled several dirty secrets about the singer saying he produced the majority of the songs on his “Superstar” album and did not receive a dime. This went on for years but all Wizkid had to say was that he had nothing but respect for Samklef.

Samklef was recently asked by a fan on Twitter to say the most stupid thing he has ever done on social media. Samklef responded saying fighting with Wizkid was actually a very dumb move from him.
