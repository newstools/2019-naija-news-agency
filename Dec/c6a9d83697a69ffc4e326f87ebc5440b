Freddie Ljungberg has provided an update on his Arsenal future, confirming that, despite Mikel Arteta’s appointment, he has been asked to remain. The Gunners travelled to Goodison Park earlier today, for their latest Premier League outing. Arsenal headed into proceedings in search of a bounce-back performance, on the back of a comprehensive 3-0 defeat at home to Manchester City last time out. When all was said and done on Merseyside, though, the visitors couldn’t find a way to break down a stubborn Everton backline. A disappointing 90 minutes eventually saw both sides forced to settle for a point, in a drab 0-0 stalemate. 44 – Gabriel Martinelli’s effort in the 44th minute was Arsenal’s first shot in this match, their longest wait for a first attempt in a Premier League game since May 2015 against Man Utd (51st minute).

Across these fixtures, the Swede managed just a solitary victory, 2 weeks ago versus West Ham. As such, it came as little surprise when the board at the Emirates moved decisively to appoint a new permanent tactician in Ljungberg’s place this week. On the back of mounting speculation, it was confirmed yesterday afternoon that Mikel Arteta had departed his role as Pep Guardiola’s assistant at Manchester City, to take up the managerial reins at his former club: 🥁 Introducing our new head coach… Mikel Arteta ✍️ pic.twitter.com/PTmElGDMR3 — Arsenal (@Arsenal) December 20, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js This had understandably since led to question marks surrounding Freddie Ljungberg’s future, with it having been unclear whether the 42-year-old remained part of the Arsenal vision moving forward. Based on his latest comments, though, Ljungberg is still viewed as an important member of staff at the Emirates. Speaking on the back of Arsenal’s Everton stalemate, the former winger confirmed that he has been asked to remain at the club, and will hold a meeting with Mikel Arteta tomorrow to discuss his role moving forward: ‘I spoke to him a little bit today and yesterday. The club have said they want me to stay and I will chat with him (Arteta) tomorrow.’ Manchester City vs Leicester betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Liverpool vs Flamengo betting tips: Club World Cup Final match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
