While the other girls were returned, Leah was held by her captors who insisted she change her religion. In a video shared by Ahmed Salkida, the journalist known for his access to the insurgents, Bwala revealed that Leah is still alive. He said: I appeal to the federal government to come to our aid. As you can see behind me are fellow Christians who were arrested on various points. I equally appeal to Christian association to do whatever is within their reach in order to rescue us because when we came, we saw some workers here, particularly workers with food organisation, however, shortly, they were executed. We also saw that the government has not done enough that is why Leah Sharibu is still with this group. We, therefore, appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari.
