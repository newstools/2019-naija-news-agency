Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has this evening sarcastically suggested that Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger likely suffered fractured ribs in the incident that resulted in Heung-min Son being given his marching orders during the meeting between the sides earlier today. Spurs welcomed their capital rivals to north London this evening, for a Premier League clash. The matchup came as a crucial one in the race for a top-4 spot, with Frank Lampardâ€™s visitors having occupied the final of the English top-flightâ€™s Champions League berths ahead of kick-off. A victory for Tottenham, though, would have seen the in-form Lilywhites leapfrog their opponents. But, when all was said and done, it was struggling Chelsea who emerged with all 3 points. A pair of first-half goals from Man of the Match Willian eventually proved the difference between the London clubs, bringing to an end a run of 4 defeats in 5 for the Blues. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Willian is @premierleague Man of the Match â€¢ 1st PL goals against Tottenham

Any hope that the hosts had of having their improvement reflected in the scoreline, though, was all-but extinguished just past the hour-mark. This came after Heung-min Son was given his marching orders. A tangle between the South Korean attacker and Antonio Rudiger in the Chelsea half saw the former needlessly kick out, with a VAR review of the incident having eventually seen Son given his marching orders. 3 â€“ Son Heung-Min is the first player to be sent off three times in a calendar year in the Premier League since Lee Cattermole in 2010.

Speaking in a post-match interview on Sky Sports, Tottenham boss Mourinho suggested that Sonâ€™s red card was â€˜a strange oneâ€™, whilst also sarcastically criticising Antonio Rudiger for his role in the incident: â€˜I hope Rudiger will recover from broken ribs because he will have broken ribs for sure.â€™ Mourinho continued: â€˜If he does nothing and the referee immediately gives a yellow card to Rudiger then he wonâ€™t have a reaction.â€™ â€˜But if he doesnâ€™t then you can have this sort of emotional reaction, which the referee and VAR has to analyse.â€™ â€˜For me football is football. The Premier League will be English football and for me that red card is a strange one.â€™ â€˜But I donâ€™t want to focus on that because my team lost and I have to be complimentary to my opponents because they had the better handle on the game.â€™ Chelsea & Man City dominate Alan Shearerâ€™s Premier League Team of the Decade Reports of racist abuse towards Chelseaâ€™s Antonio Rudiger during Tottenham clash Source: Great Goals Chelseaâ€™s victory over Tottenham this evening saw Frank Lampard completely outshine counterpart Jose Mourinho, when it mattered most.
