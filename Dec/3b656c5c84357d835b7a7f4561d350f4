Memories of first love, first kiss, loss and gain? That was the atmosphere that clouded Day 2 of the Flytime Music Festival which took over the Eko Convention Center in Lagos with nostalgia, as American R&B legends Boyz II Men headlined a rapturous set on Saturday, December 21, 2019. The second day of Nigeria’s most prestigious music festival featured an evening of soft singing, retro dancing and poignant entertainment, as thousands gathered to take the walk down memory lane and relive some of the greatest moments of music consumption over the past 3 decades. It was also a night where Afro-soul music lovers celebrated some of their favourite local stars. Boyz II Men, the American R&B and hip hop vocal group from Philadelphia are best known for their ballads and acapella harmonies. Currently composed of Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman, the trio occupy an emotional part of Nigerian music history due to their dominance in the 90s. Their catalogues have spent 50 weeks cumulatively at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. On the night, openers Somadina, Ade Laoye and Lami Philips set the right tone for the night, with inspired performances, they were joined by DJ Jimmy Jatt who played an expansive set, moving from nostalgic selections to contemporary hits. Waje carried through with more magic, moving the crowd with a live set. Headliners Boyz II Men would later take to the stage, where they pulled off a MASTERCLASS. Moving between singing, miming and conversations and ruminations about their journey through time and the dynamics of love. Clad in all-white, the trio delivered nearly 2 hours of live music. Moving through their hits, the crowd—caught up in the moment—spent half the night as willing backup singers, chorusing the songs and filling the hall with voices. Roses were handed over during the performance of ‘I’ll make love to you’, while the collective emotional screams during ‘End of the road’, shook the hall. Organized by renowned live experience promoters Flytime Promotions, the Flytime Music Festival continues its march. After the thriller of Pepsi Rhythm Unplugged on Day 1, Day 2 continued that excellence. Day 3 will welcome the hottest girl of the summer, Megan Thee Stallion to new Flytime franchise—the Alternative Concert—TODAY. Flytime Music Festival has also announced the Everything Savage Concert, headlined by Tiwa Savage on MONDAY, 23rd of December. The festival will close on CHRISTMAS DAY with a headliner concert by African Giant BURNA BOY. <img width="300" height="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC_3305-copy-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />
