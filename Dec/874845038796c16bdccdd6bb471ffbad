According to her, she was fraudulently approached to comment on how God has been good to her. Unknown to her, the video was edited to make it seem like she was advertising for the church. The “49-99” singer revealed that she would be taking legal action if the video is not retracted and is in ni way associated with the church. It has been brought to my attention that there is viral video that includes me advertising an upcoming coza event. I want to state that I have nothing to do with the church and certainly do not endorse their events. I’m extremely disappointed that I was fraudulently approached to simply comment on how good God has been to me and it has been wrongly edited to use my image to create an advert to deceive people. Coza this is wrong!!I will be taking action if this is not immediately retracted.
