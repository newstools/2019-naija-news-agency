The first trailer for the new James Bond movie “No Time to Die” is intense and comes with high-stakes, foreboding the end of an era and the start of a new one. The two minute trailer comes after a 15 second teaser was released on Monday and a series of character posters on Tuesday. The film has Daniel Craig on what has been said to be his last film as 007, and also introduces Lashana Lynch (who we see in the trailer threatening to put a bullet in Bond’s knee) who has been said to be taking over as 007. The movie stars Oscar winner Rami Malek as the villain Safin. We can’t wait to see this one in the cinemas. Watch the trailer below: The post James Bond’s “No Time To Die” Trailer is Intense!
