Chelsea were handed their second successive league defeat on Saturday. The Blues lost 2-1 to Manchester City last weekend but even in defeat, Chelsea still looked impressive and could have easily scored more. And given West Ham were both without a clean sheet and a win in their previous seven league ties before traveling to Stamford Bridge, a win for Frank Lampard’s men did seem pretty likely. However, Aaron Creswell put the Hammers 1-0 up 48 minutes in and that is how the tie finished. Although West Ham emerged with the victory on Saturday, it would be Chelsea who dominated proceedings. Chelsea had the lion’s share of possession, earning 66% over 90 minutes compared to West Ham’s 34%. The Blues then had 19 shots, compared just five from West Ham. But only six of those 19 shots from Chelsea actually hit the target. After losing to Chelsea, Jorginho has called on his side to be more clinical when they create a chance: “Tired? I don’t think so. Maybe yes, but we created some chances and we did not score when we should and I think that is the problem. “You can create so many chances and when you create you have to score. “I think we need to be more clinical when we create a chance. “We didn’t and we concede a goal and then West Ham were so closed after they scored and it was difficult. They [West Ham] played well. They had some chances and they scored.” As quoted by Chelsea’s official website.
