According to Tiwa Savage, the relationship she has with Wizkid is special and is of no one’s business. Speaking about it on stage during her performance, she said; This is not a community relationship, this is a one on one relationship… I might be older, but the older the better. Although Tiwa Savage did not state the kind of relationship she’s admitting that they have, she’s simply stating that whatever it is, people should let her be with her best friend. Commenting on the issue after his performance, Wizkid implied in his statement that women should stop trying to share him as he is enough for everyone.
