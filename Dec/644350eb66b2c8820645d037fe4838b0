Just in case you didn’t know about the gist, starting from the top, here’s what went down: Cardi B came to Nigeria, enjoyed her stay, and her “parte after parte” trended on social media with people “staning and re-staning” the rapper for her personality. Toke Makinwa, who was part of those who admired the rapper, took to her Insta stories on Sunday to drop her reaction to Cardi B’s visit. She said: These are the issues. Nigerians Cardi B is so real, I stan. Your own celebs living their lives like her. Such a disgrace! Morally corrupt! Bad role model! So plastic! so crass! So unintelligent! So razz! So loud!. Comedian and actor Yomi Black then reposted Toke’s post on his Instagram on Sunday. According to him, Cardi B never denied being a stripper, and he dared Toke to reveal how she affords her “baby girl for life” lifestyle. He wrote: You see why people love someone like Cardi B? She owns her shit, just like the Kardashians. You get what you expect. She hasn’t denied being a stripper or enjoying showing her body. She doesn’t go around forming motivational speaker and quoting Bible passages on social media like some Saint. Dear Toke, I dare you to openly show how you can afford your lifestyle. And don’t come with shit like you’re an actress or OAP because we all know how much both earn. Also, don’t spew shit about endorsement deals because we are in marketing communications and know how much these deals are worth. This has got to be the most hypocritical post of 2019. And then… the clap-back! Toke Makinwa posted a screenshot of her DM with Yomi back in 2017. He wrote: “You are such an Inspiration. I love you Toke.” Toke Makinwa then had some interesting things to say. She wrote: Excuse me while I drop my crown for 5 minutes. Inside life…… this life is a pot of beans. Now this is a public service announcement, if I have ever supported you with my time, platform, money, and more pls don’t ever come for me. You look stupid when you try. Some of you will be all up in the DM looking for favors yet want to sound Intelligent in these SM streets. Should we really tell Nigerians how you went from licking my ass to dragging me online? This world we live in is strange, I have messages from you like this one, I would usually look away cos you are not the first but Yomi, you ungrateful fool, I have worked with you on projects with only a promise of “i”ll pay you back when we find sponsors”, which you never did, and I let it go, I have stuck my neck out for you when stylists, designers and the likes wanted your head on a platter cos you made them work without pay, when all you had was a dream, I was willing to support you with my platform, I have fed cast and crew on your shameless sham of a set and you have the nerve to come for me???? I have receipts of how much of a loser you are but I’ll leave this one here, you asked for free TM bags for a product placement on your production which I turned down cos I’m sorry your platform does nothing for me, and I am running a business, I asked you to pay for it and you got mad, you’ve always taken but never given to anyone, who have you helped??? Who have you supported? it’s always been the other way round, you couldn’t get a freebie and now i am your enemy? Tell me, if I’m everything you say I am, why do you want to associate yourself with me? I was such an inspiration to you in private huh???? See my people hustle oooo so you don’t go from “you’re such an inspiration” to this #MCM #yourmcmisreaching.  Excuse me while I drop my crown for 5 minutes. Inside life…… this life is a pot of beans.
