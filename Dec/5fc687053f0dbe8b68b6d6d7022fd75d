Just in case you haven’t had your daily dose of cuteness, Banke and Damilola will help you out. Their pre-wedding shoot is all you need. The beautiful couple were once high school mates and then reconnected at a friend’s birthday party but didn’t say a word to each other. Though Damilola was definitely captured by her beauty (he even remembers what she wore and the colour of her lipstick), as a sharp guy, he made enquiries from his friend who happened to be Banke’s friend. At that time Banke wasn’t ready for a relationship but she agreed to have a conversation with him. The first conversation was about 2 hours and now 5 years later, they are engaged! I mean, what a beautiful story.  Read all about it below and catch up with more love stories here on www.bellanaijaweddings.com. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1230583" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.16.jpg?resize=1500%2C1445&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1500" height="1445" data-recalc-dims="1" /> How We Met
By the bride-to-be, Dami I went to my friend Laoyin’s house party in Manchester back in 2013 and it was the perfect opportunity to catch up with old friends and eat meat pies. I remember seeing Damilola standing by the door with a friend but I did not even think twice about him. I left the party and did not say a word to him. After a couple of days, my very good friend Yusuf calls me and was literally interrogating me about what I wore to a party in Manchester and what I was doing, etc. <img class="size-full wp-image-1230584 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.17.jpg?resize=1174%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1174" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1230576" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.09.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1230577" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.10.jpg?resize=1309%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1309" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1230579" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1294&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1500" height="1294" data-recalc-dims="1" /> He eventually told me that his friend (Damilola) was interested and asked if he could give him my number. I was extremely skeptical because even though he went to my high school, I didn’t really know the guy and to be honest I did not want a relationship at that time! After a pep talk from Yusuf, I finally agreed! Damilola wasted no time and called me the following day. He introduced himself as Damilola on the phone and I pretended not to know who he was. I said ‘Damilola? Which Damilola is this?🤣 (girls, please tell me I’m not alone). We spoke for two hours that day and 5 years later we got engaged! <img class="size-full wp-image-1230573 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.06.jpg?resize=1138%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1138" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230575 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.08.jpg?resize=1500%2C1316&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1500" height="1316" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230574 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.07.jpg?resize=1138%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1138" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230581 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.14.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230580 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.13.jpg?resize=1165%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1165" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230578 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.11.jpg?resize=1145%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1145" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230572 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.05.jpg?resize=1200%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1200" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> How We Met
By the groom-to-be, Damilola My attendance at parties during University was few and far between (was not my scene). But on the 16th of November 2013, I got convinced to attend a high school friend’s birthday party, where I expected to have nothing more than a mediocre night. I arrived at the party and all was as expected, I saw a few old friends, made my rounds saying hellos and catching up with several people. Then across the dance floor, I see a girl in a black dress. It was her style that caught my attention, her hair laid all back and the dark purple lipstick. <img class="size-full wp-image-1230587 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.20.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230592 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.25.jpg?resize=1177%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1177" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230594 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.27.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230589 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.22.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> I couldn’t make out who it was, so I moved around the room to get a better angle in order to see her face. Once I did, I was immediately infatuated, and then I realized, I actually knew her, (we went to high school together)  and she was also really good friends with one of my closest friends.  All night, I plotted how I was going to strike up a conversation with her, but chickened out every time I tried to make a move. I left the party thinking I’d forget all about her, but 5 days later, she was still on my mind. So, I called my friend (who’s really good friends with her) to get the 411 on her. Lo and behold, she was single! (I remember thinking how on earth could I be that lucky, that a girl that stunning was single). <img class="size-full wp-image-1230590 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.23.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230591 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.24.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1230585 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.18.jpg?resize=1055%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1055" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> I asked my friend to ask her if it was okay for him to give me her number, to which she immediately replied: “NO” (those of you who know Banke would expect nothing less 😂). My guy obviously had my back, so he convinced her to allow him to give me her number. I called her the next day, we spoke for over 2 hours. This was 6 years ago and now after countless more 2+ hour conversations here we are. <img class="size-full wp-image-1230586 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BankingonDami-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.19.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Credits Photography: @bedgepictures
