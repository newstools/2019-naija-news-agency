We got London on da Track

Aye, Dolce & Gabbana (Dolce & Gabbana)
Got me goin’ bananas (Goin’ bananas)
Aye
Pass me the po, pass me the jo
Pass me the ting wey dey make me go
Pass me the codeine, make me slow
Pass me the kpo kpo di kpo [Bridge: Davido]
When I’m lookin’ through your eyes, all I see is your waist
True that African waist
And I don’t got no time to waste
Know they make me the chase [Verse 1: Summer Walker]
You know time is of the essence
Come and give me blessings
Let it rain down on me
We got no time to waste
Come get a taste
Fulfill out my fantasies, oh
We start from the bed to the floor (Floor)
Can you give me more and more?
Never had like this before
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa [Hook: Summer Walker]
Wanna give it all to you-ou-ou
I wanna give it all to you-ou-ou
‘Cause when I look [Chorus: Davido, Summer Walker & Both]
Said she lookin’ through my eyes and she seeing designers (Yeah)
Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana (& Gabbana)
Dolce & Gabbana (& Gabbana)
Yeah
Said see she lookin’ through my eyes and she seen designers (seen desingers)
Aye, Dolce & Gabbana (Gabbana)
Got me goin’ bananas (Bananas)
Aye
Pass me the po, pass me the jo
Pass me the ting wey dey make me go
Pass me the codeine, make me slow
Pass me the kpo kpo di kpo [Verse 2: Davido]
Pe owo wole
Them no like as we dey shana’wole
Anywhere, i must gbe ori wole
And I must become the landlord, aye (Yeah)
Yankee ti ji
I just wanna make history
With all my people back home missin’ me
I’m like what the fuck, this shit like a dream to me
But that don’t speak to me [Hook: Summer Walker]
Wanna give it all to you-ou-ou
I wanna give it all to you-ou-ou
Wanna give it all to you-ou-ou
