Saturday’s early Premier League kick-off saw Liverpool playing host to Watford. The Reds began the day with a commanding eight-point lead atop of the Premier League. And a win over the Hornets would have put Liverpool temporarily 11 points clear of 2nd place Leicester. Despite a fairly quiet start, which saw Watford defending well and keeping the pace of the tie pretty slow, Liverpool eventually took the lead through Mohamed Salah with 38 minutes on the clock. Relegation-battling Watford would have their fair share of chances throughout the 90 minutes but it was pretty clear their forwards were lacking confidence and they were unable to capitalise on said opportunities. Salah would eventually kill the game off in the 90th minute, adding his and Liverpool’s second of the day. While Salah scored Liverpool’s second of the day 90 minutes in, the Merseyside powerhouse nearly had a second shortly after the interval. Sadio Mane headed home from a Xherdan Shaqiri cross but the Senegalese winger was adjudged to have been offside after a VAR check. Fine margins!

Klopp also went on to explain why he doesn’t celebrate goals anymore, stating he does not because you now have to wait until somebody says it is a goal: “I had no clue where it was offside, to be honest. “I don’t celebrate goals anymore because you have to wait until somebody says it is a goal. “I thought there was one pass before where maybe it was offside, but that Sadio was offside, I couldn’t see.” As quoted by Sky Sports News.
