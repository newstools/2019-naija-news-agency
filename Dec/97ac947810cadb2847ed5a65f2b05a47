The 2019 Ballon d’Or ceremony took place earlier this month. After Liverpool clinched their 6th Champions League trophy and earned 97 points in the Premier League last season, it wasn’t too much of surprise to see the Merseyside powerhouse dominating the Ballon d’Or top 10. Liverpool had Alisson, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Virgil van Dijk all named in the top 10. However, while the European champions dominated the nominations, it would be FC Barcelona’s Lionel Messi who took home the award. It would be Messi’s 6th Ballon d’Or with the Argentine now having won the award more times than any other player in history. Lionel Messi from @FCBarcelona is the 2019 Ballon d’Or winner!

But out of all of their players, you probably would have argued that Virgil van Dijk deserved the award the most. The imposing central defender has been key to Liverpool’s success since his big-money move from Southampton. And the Dutchman had already won a number of awards in 2019 including the Premier League Player of the Season and the UEFA Men’s Player of the Year award. Van Dijk has since opened up on losing out on the Ballon d’Or to Messi: “I was slightly disappointed. “I decided I would still go to the ceremony – and, in the end, it was a super night. “I spoke to Messi during the ­evening. It was not the longest ­conversation because he doesn’t speak a lot of English. “But it was still enough to make me realise that the respect between us now also runs the other way.” As quoted by the Mirror.
