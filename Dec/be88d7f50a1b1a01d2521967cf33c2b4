The reliable David Ornstein of the Athletic has provided an update on the situation surrounding Nathan Ake’s potential return to Chelsea. 24-year-old stopper Ake came up through the youth ranks at Stamford Bridge, before breaking into the first-team setup of the Blues for the first time as a raw teen in 2012. The years that followed resulted in the Dutchman being sent out on a series of loan spells, the last of which saw Ake join Bournemouth on a season-long deal in the summer of 2016. The youngster’s impressive displays over the opening half of the campaign eventually resulted in Chelsea opting to recall Ake the following winter, but, after Bournemouth tabled a club-record £20 million bid to bring the defender back to the Vitality in the summer of 2017, those in charge at Stamford Bridge came to the decision that it was time to part with their youth product. The seasons since, though, have seen Ake go on to establish himself as one of the Premier League’s most highly-regarded stoppers. The 13-time capped Dutch international featured in every one of Bournemouth’s 76 league fixtures over the last two campaigns, proving a rock at the back for Eddie Howe’s men.

Chief among these clubs have actually been the 24-year-old’s former side, Chelsea. The Blues have long been rumoured to hold a buyback option on Ake, worth £40 million. And, as outlined above, the reliable David Ornstein has provided an update on the possibility of Chelsea and their former stopper reuniting in the near future. It is claimed that the Pensioners’ board need to make a decision on Ake’s potential return imminently. In fact, if Chelsea do intend to activate their clause on the Dutchman, they will need to do so next month. This comes with the capital outfit’s first refusal option on Ake set to expire before the 2020 summer transfer window. This week @TheAthleticUK:
