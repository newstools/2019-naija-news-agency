No, this is about Migo going out to the places where their customers transact to show them that they are still in the business of saying Yes! <img class="size-full wp-image-1373526 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/B30712E7-17EE-43EA-A917-D0D1EBAF6F9B.jpeg?resize=354%2C233&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="354" height="233" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Migo, formerly known as kwikmoney, treated occupants of Tejuosho Market to a memorable experience. Their objective was to familiarize new and existing customers with the new brand name, Migo, and assure them that Migo is still here to say Yes to their needs. The experiential activation was also aimed at educating new customers on how to start their journey with Migo by following the steps below: As for the entertainment, letâ€™s just say you needed to be there to truly understand the exhilaration that took over the complex and had shop owners and shoppers alike stopping to take part. The education was highly interactive as participants were tested on their knowledge of the Migo brand and winners for the day were rewarded with exciting prizes. Migo took its connection with customers to a new level by opening the floor to Tejuosho market occupants willing to express themselves creatively. The spontaneous performances got the crowd so hyped up that they started throwing money on the stage to appreciate the performers. You never imagined there would be mention of rap and dance battles here, did you? Traders went up against traders in an epic dance-off as others unleashed their inner Eminem in rap battles. Amidst all the activity, shop owners who had used the service stepped forward and testified to the convenience of Migo, encouraging new customers to try out the service. <img class="size-full wp-image-1373527 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BCC8B5B2-9B2F-4D1B-8625-79FF587DEAF7.jpeg?resize=335%2C231&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="335" height="231" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Tejuosho market will remember the events of that day for a long time.
