The animal lover who has amassed over 4 million followers across Instagram and Twitter, due to his friendly interactions with all kinds of animals and his unique ability to gain their trust, has announced on his Instagram stories that he is excited about coming to Lagos, Nigeria, for the very first time. The 21-year-old’s social media popularity started in 2016 when he befriended a family of deer in his neighborhood in Pennsylvania. The Internet seemed to take a liking to it and it just went viral overnight. It’s not yet clear the places Brother Nature will be visiting in Nigeria but we hope he has so much fun during his time in Nigeria. <img class="size-full wp-image-1372517 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Brother-Nature.jpg?resize=607%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="607" height="1080" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1372518 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kevin-Pena.jpg?resize=607%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="607" height="1080" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Photo credit: @kelv The post Brother Nature is Excited to be Visiting Nigeria for the First Time! appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
