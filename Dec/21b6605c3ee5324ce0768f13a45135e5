Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has this evening revealed why Jamie Vardy is absent from the club’s matchday squad to take on West Ham United. The Foxes are currently locked in Premier League action with Manuel Pellegrini’s men, at the London Stadium. Leicester headed into proceedings in search of a bounce-back performance, on the back of their first 2-game losing streak of the campaign. High-profile meetings with Manchester City and Liverpool over the last week both resulted in Brendan Rodgers’ outfit falling to deserved defeats. The latter of these came at the King Power on Thursday, when Liverpool put 4 past the Foxes, to open up a hefty 13-point lead atop the English top-flight. As things stand, with 20 minutes on the clock in the English capital, meanwhile, Leicester and West Ham remains goalless. The visitors’ hopes of getting their form back on track with all 3 points this evening, though, were dampened ahead of kick-off. This came after Brendan Rodgers announced his starting XI to take on the Hammers. The XI featured a massive 9 changes from the side that started versus Liverpool on Thursday, with the likes of Çağlar Söyüncü, Youri Tielemans and James Maddison having dropped out: Sponsored by @eToro, here is your Leicester City team for today’s game! 🔵#WhuLei — Leicester City (@LCFC) December 28, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Absent from not only the Leicester line-up, but the club’s matchday squad altogether, meanwhile, was top scorer Jamie Vardy.
