Newly-appointed Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has this evening assured that Mesut Ozil remains a ‘massive’ player for the club, with the German playmaker having also taken to social media to welcome his new boss back to north London. On the back of weeks of rampant speculation, the news that Arsenal fans across the globe were anxiously awaiting finally arrived earlier today. After Freddie Ljungberg’s attempts to steady the ship at his former club on the back of Unai Emery’s sacking late last month proved unsuccessful, the Gunners announced the appointment of a permanent manager this afternoon. In something of a risk, Arsenal have opted to hand the inexperienced Mikel Arteta the reins at the Emirates. The Spaniard has put pen-to-paper on a 3-and-a-half year deal, as confirmed across the club’s social media platforms: 🥁 Introducing our new head coach… Mikel Arteta ✍️ pic.twitter.com/PTmElGDMR3 — Arsenal (@Arsenal) December 20, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As such, on the back of his appointment being made official, Arteta has since spoken for the first time as Arsenal boss. During a press conference this evening, the now-former Manchester City no.2 was drawn on a host of topics, one of which surrounded Mesut Ozil. German midfielder Ozil has endured a disappointing campaign to date, having been largely left out in the cold by Unai Emery. He has, though, been reintroduced as a first-team regular by Freddie Ljungberg of late, with Mikel Arteta having hinted that he also intends to utilise the World Cup winner on a consistent basis: ‘He is a massive player for this club.’ ‘What I want is to understand how they are feeling and what they need. You have to understand it.’ ‘When I understand them, I can take the excuses out of them and focus on the things that are relevant and have an impact for the team on and off the pitch. ‘ ‘He is a massive player. I know, when he ticks, what he can bring to the team.’ Quotes via Goal Ozil himself, meanwhile, has taken to Twitter this evening, to welcome his new boss and former teammate back to the club: Welcome back to the @Arsenal family! 🙌🏼⚽️ @m8arteta #M1Ö #YaGunnersYa pic.twitter.com/xvXI72mkEE — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) December 20, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Manchester City vs Leicester betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Liverpool vs Flamengo betting tips: Club World Cup Final match preview & predictions Everton vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Bournemouth vs Burnley betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
