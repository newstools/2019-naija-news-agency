Laurent Koscielny this evening provided an insight into the reasoning behind his decision to depart Arsenal this past summer. Long-time then-Arsenal star Koscielny dropped a bombshell on the club back in July, when the Frenchman informed Unai Emery and co. that he would not be joining his fellow teammates on their pre-season tour of the US. An official announcement across the Gunners’ website and social media channels regarding the situation read as follows: ‘Laurent Koscielny has refused to travel to the US for our pre-season tour.’ ‘We are very disappointed by Laurent’s actions, which are against our clear instructions.’ ‘We hope to resolve this matter and will not be providing any further comment at this time.’ LONDON, ENGLAND – MARCH 10: Laurent Koscielny of Arsenal celebrates their win during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Manchester United at Emirates Stadium on March 10, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

Speaking in an interview with Canal+, the veteran stopper cited unhappiness in north London, and a ‘need’ to return to France, for his family’s sake: ‘I can understand that Arsenal fans did not expect me to leave.’ ‘Nobody expected it.
