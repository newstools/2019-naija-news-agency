Everton have this afternoon been dealt a blow on the injury-front, during the clubâ€™s meeting with Arsenal. The Toffees are currently locked in action with Arsenal at Goodison Park, in a Premier League clash. In a strange situation, both sides are being guided through todayâ€™s proceedings by interim managers. Their respective new permanent bosses, though, are in the stands watching on. After Arsenal confirmed the appointment of former midfielder Mikel Arteta yesterday afternoon, Everton followed suit by making the high-profile arrival of Carlo Ancelotti official this morning. ðŸ”µ | Introducing the new manager of Everton Football Club, @MrAncelotti! #WelcomeMrAncelotti pic.twitter.com/zNNoix8H5R â€” Everton (@Everton) December 21, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As such, the disjointed nature of the first-half at Goodison this afternoon has since proven little surprise. Despite a buzz in the atmosphere on Merseyside ahead of kick-off, both sides have struggled to carve out chances, resulting in a 0-0 scoreline at the interval. An all-round disappointing opening 45 minutes for hosts Everton, meanwhile, was also compounded by a blow on the personnel front. With just 10 minutes on the clock, Alex Iwobi, who was of course facing off against former club Arsenal today, pulled up with what appeared to be a hamstring problem. After being seen to by the hostsâ€™ medical team, the attacker was subsequently forced off, to be replaced by Cenk Tosun: 11â€² Weâ€™re forced into an early change as @alexiwobi limps off.
