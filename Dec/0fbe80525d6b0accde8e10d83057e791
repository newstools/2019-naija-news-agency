David Ornstein has given an update on Arsenal’s managerial search, while also ruling out recently sacked manager Carlo Ancelotti. The Italian manager was sacked by Napoli on Tuesday evening after beating Genk 4-0. Napoli have struggled in Serie A this season, with the club down in 7th and without a win in their last five games. They are also 17 points behind league leaders Inter Milan. Though, there hasn’t just been issues on the field. Back in November, Napoli bosses threatened to take legal action against their own players. This came after they refused to go on a ‘ritiro’, which means players would live with each other either at a hotel or their training ground until the next fixture. After his sacking, Ancelotti has been heavily linked with the Arsenal job. However, it doesn’t look like the Gunners are interested in him.

That certainly suggests that they will not be making any move for the Italian after he became available on Tuesday. Though, that isn’t the only information Ornstein has on Arsenal’s search for a new manager. Despite wanting a new manager as soon as possible, Arsenal want the ‘right man over quick decision’. Fluid/changeable but current sense:
– Arsenal want situation settled asap but right man over quick decision
– If No1 pick available, gets done
– If available in summer, FL holds fort
– If No1 pick unclear, FL holds fort + has chance to impress

If their top target is not available until the summer, Freddie Ljungberg will remain in charge until then. If Arsenal are not sure on who their top target is, Freddie Ljungberg will continue and could even be named the new boss if he impresses.
