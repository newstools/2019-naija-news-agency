The German evangelist died in the early hours of Saturday as revealed by his wife, Anni. Buhari in a statement signed by Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, described Bonnke’s transition as a great loss to Nigeria, Africa and entire world. The statement read: The President condoles with government and people of Germany, family and friends of the great preacher and teacher of the Bible, and all his co-labourers in the vineyard, praying that the good Lord will comfort all those that mourn him. President Buhari affirms that Bonnke’s crusades in Nigeria, across Africa and the globe strongly accentuated the message of Jesus Christ, and his vision and zeal for the salvation of souls clearly helped the world in understanding the power of love and kindness as universal language. The President prays that the Almighty God will accept the soul of the departed preacher, believing that his legendary contributions to the body of Christ in teaching and writing will always be remembered by posterity.
