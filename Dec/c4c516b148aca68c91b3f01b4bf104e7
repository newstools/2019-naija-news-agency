Tottenham defender Toby Alderweireld has signed a new contract with the club, keeping him at Spurs for another four years. The Belgian has looked set to leave Tottenham for a while now. AS Roma were heavily linked in the summer with his contract set to expire in the coming summer. Manchester United and Barcelona were also linked earlier in the year. However, he continued to feature heavily for Spurs and despite a reported £25million release clause, a move never materialised. Now, Alderweireld has committed his future to the club.

While there are no further details on the contract, the Evening Standard have reported how much Alderweireld will earn. They claim that the Belgian will earn around £150,000-a-week. That is supposedly three times bigger than his previous contract, which netted him £50,000-a-week. Speaking about his new deal, Alderweireld was clearly happy to remain at Spurs. “I’m very, very happy, no words can describe. Another couple of years at Spurs, there’s no place I’d be happier,” he explained on the club’s Instagram page. “I’m honoured to play for this club and I’m a small piece of getting to the next level in a couple of seasons, reaching the Champions League season in and season out and then reaching the final as well. “I’m a Spurs player and I couldn’t see myself playing for another team. I’ve got love for the club and it feels both ways, I love the fans and the stadium. It’s like I’m living some sort of dream.”   “I couldn’t be happier. I’m honoured to play at this Club.” – @tobyalderweireld #COYS A post shared by  Tottenham Hotspur (@spursofficial) on Dec 20, 2019 at 2:36am PST //www.instagram.com/embed.js  See also: Liverpool vs Flamengo betting tips: Club World Cup Final match preview & predictions Everton vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Newcastle United vs Crystal Palace betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Aston Villa vs Southampton betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals Alderweireld to stay put?
