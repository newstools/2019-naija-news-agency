Ben White is a product of Brighton’s youth system. The 22-year-old has featured just twice for Brighton’s senior side but he has notched up 42 appearances for the Seagulls’ under-23 side. White would also enjoy a fairly successful loan spell with Newport County during the 2017/18 campaign, in which he racked up 51 appearances for the League Two outfit. The Englishman then made 16 appearances for Peterborough in the second half of last season. And now, White is out on loan honing his craft in the Championship with promotion-chasing Leeds United. Leeds look almost certain to secure promotion to the Premier League this season. The North Yorkshire outfit are currently 2nd in the Championship, two points behind table-topping West Brom. However, Leeds have opened up a commanding 10-point gap between themselves and 3rd place Preston. Leeds also currently boast the best defensive record in England’s 2nd division, conceding just 13 goals in 22 league ties this term. And Ben White has been a pivotal member of Leeds’ backline this season. White has completed 90 minutes in all 22 of Leeds’ Championship outings in 2019/20. <img class="size-large wp-image-1133961" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186500792-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="682" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Now, after impressing with Leeds, White is being linked with a move to a top Premier League side. According to the Sun, Chelsea have put White on their wanted list for a shock January transfer swoop. Chelsea are of course, now able to sign players in the winter window after their transfer ban was reduced earlier this month. And as per the aforementioned report from the Sun, Chelsea are so serious about White, they see him going into the first team quickly. But is White what Chelsea need right now? The Blues don’t have the best defensive record under Frank Lampard and signing another fairly inexperienced centre-back may not be what they should do.
