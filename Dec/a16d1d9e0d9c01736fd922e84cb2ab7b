Chelsea have this afternoon unveiled a special new kit, to mark the 50th anniversary of the clubâ€™s first-ever triumph in the FA Cup The kit, which can be seen below, features a royal blue jersey and shorts, to go along with yellow socks. Significantly, the Bluesâ€™ sponsor, Yokohama Tyres, and manufacturer, Nike, are also darkened, in contrast to the standout white colours on the clubâ€™s home kit. This gives the jersey a sleek, old-fashioned look. Elsewhere, a gold lion badge features prominently, â€˜replicated through a modern silicone executionâ€™. This special kit is set to be released to commemorate the upcoming 50-year mark since Chelseaâ€™s 1970 FA Cup final replay victory over Leeds United, a result which marked the clubâ€™s first-ever triumph in English footballâ€™s premiere cup competition. It will officially go on sale on the 2nd of January, at Chelseaâ€™s Stamford Bridge Megastore. ICYMI â€“ The Blues have a new @nikefootball shirt which celebrates 50 years since our first FA Cup triumph in 1970! ðŸ’™ðŸ’› Everything you need to know, including when you can see it in actionâ€¦ ðŸ‘‡ #ItsAChelseaThing #ThePrideOfLondon â€” Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) December 21, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Chelsea are set to return to action tomorrow evening, in a crunch Premier League meeting with Tottenham. As things stand, Frank Lampardâ€™s men occupy the final top-4 berth in the English top-flight. What was previously a comfortable advantage for the Pensioners over the chasing pack, though, has largely-evaporated over recent weeks. A dismal run of form on Chelseaâ€™s part has seen them fall to defeat in 4 of their last 5 league outings. The latest of these came last weekend, when the Londoners were downed by a goal to nil at home to struggling Bournemouth. This, coupled with the upturn in form being enjoyed by Tottenham since Jose Mourinhoâ€™s appointment, has seen Spurs close the gap to their capital rivals to just 3 points. As such, another victory for the Lilywhites on Sunday would see them oust Chelsea from the top-4.
