Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has this evening provided a fitness update on Dejan Lovren, ahead of his sideâ€™s meeting with Watford. Kloppâ€™s European champions are set to welcome the struggling Hornets to Anfield tomorrow afternoon, for the weekendâ€™s Premier League opener. The Reds will head into proceedings brimming with confidence, sitting pretty atop the English top-flight, and having secured their spot in the last-16 of the Champions League on Tuesday night. After making short work of Bournemouth last weekend, Liverpool put Red Bull Salzburg to the sword by 2 goals to nil 3 days later. This saw the Merseyside giants top the Group E table, and keep their hopes of retaining their Champions League crown alive. 3 â€“ Liverpool have progressed past the Champions League group stages in all three of their campaigns in the competition under JÃ¼rgen Klopp, having failed to do so in their previous two seasons before the Germanâ€™s arrival (2009-10 and 2014-15). Unstoppable. #SALLIV pic.twitter.com/WlLQIgOvpO â€” OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 10, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js One blow on an otherwise positive night for Liverpool on Tuesday, however, came on the personnel front. The player to have picked up the problem was Dejan Lovren. Croatian stopper Lovren was actually a major doubt to even feature versus Salzburg, after being forced off during the Redsâ€™ routine victory over Bournemouth. After being opted for from the off by Jurgen Klopp in Austria, though, the 30-year-oldâ€™s latest appearance was also brought to a premature end, shortly after the interval. What appeared to be a knee problem saw Lovren pull up on the halfway-line, with the defender having subsequently limped off to be replaced by Joe Gomez. As such, speaking in a press conference this afternoon, Klopp was inevitably drawn on Lovrenâ€™s well-being, with the Liverpool boss having confirmed that the former Southampton man has been ruled out of his sideâ€™s meeting with Watford: â€˜He is out, muscle this time â€“ more serious than last time.â€™ â€˜We donâ€™t have a timeframe.â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s a concern, how you can imagine.â€™ Lovrenâ€™s injury comes with fellow central-defender Joel Matip, and emergency stopper Fabinho, both also sidelined with fitness problems of their own. As such, Klopp continued: â€˜Itâ€™s not the first time we are in a situation like this. Last year, one game Fabinho played at centre-half. Unfortunately he is out as well. Itâ€™s not too cool.â€™ JÃ¼rgen Klopp must make at least one change to #LFCâ€˜s starting line-up when @WatfordFC visit Anfield.
