As per a report from French outlet L’Equipe, Paul Pogba has his heart fully set on a departure from Manchester United. Speculation surrounding the future of Red Devils star man Pogba was rife all summer. On the back of a hit-and-miss campaign last time out, during which the Frenchman again proved himself to be one of the most infuriatingly-inconsistent players in world football, Pogba was heavily-targeted by the United faithful on the final day of the season: Pogba vs a Man Utd fan.

The former Juventus man’s agent, Mino Raiola, meanwhile, added fuel to the fire regarding a potential summer exit from Old Trafford for his client back in July, in admitting: ‘Everyone within the club from the manager to the owner knows Paul’s wishes.’ ‘Everyone knows the willingness of Paul to move on. We are in the process of that. Everyone knows what the feelings of Paul are.’ In the end, however, upon the European transfer deadline passing in September, Pogba remained a Manchester United player. This has not, though, put an end to the speculation surrounding his future. Recent reports stemming from Spain have suggested that the World Cup winner remains keen to move on. And this is a claim firmly backed by L’Equipe (via AS) today. The French outlet report that Pogba is ‘determined’ to depart Manchester United, with Real Madrid continuing to monitor the midfielder’s situation. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1150977" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Pogba-LEquipe.jpg?resize=649%2C658&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="649" height="658" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Pogba’s contract is said to be a source of concern for those in charge at Old Trafford, with his current deal due to expire in the summer of 2021. As such, L’Equipe state that United’s arm could be forced next summer, to ensure that their most-valuable asset does not depart the club for nothing 12 months later. Any potential transfer, meanwhile, would reportedly take place before Euro 2020 gets underway.
