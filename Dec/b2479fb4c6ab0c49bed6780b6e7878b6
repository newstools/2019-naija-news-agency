Real Madrid have this evening announced the club’s travelling squad set to take on Barcelona tomorrow night, with a number of significant absentees. The latest edition of European football’s most highly-anticipated fixture is set to take place in 24 hours’ time. The rescheduled El Clasico matchup between Barcelona and Real Madrid will be played out in what is no doubt set to be a tense atmosphere at the Camp Nou. While there is always an edge to meetings between Spain’s two biggest clubs, the neck-and-neck nature of this season’s La Liga race could well see tensions spill over in Catalunya on Wednesday night. As things stand, Barca and Real sit level atop the Spanish top-flight, with 35 points apiece. This comes after both clubs dropped points at the weekend, in respective stalemates with Real Sociedad and Valencia. 🚨 UNBELIEVABLE SCENES AT THE MESTALLA! ⚪ Real Madrid equalise with the last kick of the game! 😱 Thibaut Courtois almost scores a header, and then Karim Benzema scrambles the rebound home! pic.twitter.com/RMFUyVjAb0 — Watch El Clásico live on Premier Sports 📺 (@PremierSportsTV) December 15, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As such, ahead of tomorrow night’s crucial clash in the race for La Liga supremacy, Zinedine Zidane’s travelling squad has this evening been made official. The French tactician is set to be able to call on key performers such as Sergio Ramos, Toni Kroos, Gareth Bale and man-of-the-moment Karim Benzema. Real will also, however, be without the services of a number of stars.
