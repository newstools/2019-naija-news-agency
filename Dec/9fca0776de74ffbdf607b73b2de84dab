Tiwa Savage took to her Instagram to reveal that she was “fraudulently approached” to comment on how good God is, and the video was edited to create an advert. She wrote: It has been brought to my attention that there is a viral video which includes me advertising an upcoming COZA event. I want to state that i have nothing to do with the church and certainly do not endorse their events. I’m extremely disappointed that i was fraudulently approached to simply comment on how good God has been to me and it has been wrongly edited to use my image to create an advert to deceive people. COZA this is wrong!! I will be taking action if this is not immediately retracted. <img class="size-full wp-image-1372299 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tiwa.jpg?resize=750%2C1333&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="1333" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Wizkid also posted on his Twitter, that does not endorse any pastor or church. He wrote: Starboy no dey endorse no Pastor or church o! Ogun kill u fake pastors! And for dat lady that put a camera in my face! Ogun kiss u and your church.
