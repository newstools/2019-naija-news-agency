The draw for the 3rd-round of the FA Cup took place this evening, with one tie in particular having caught the majority of the headlines. After the competition’s lower-ranked teams duked it out to maintain their place in the FA Cup, the Premier League’s heavyweights entered the fray for the first time this season earlier tonight. All 20 top-flight sides discovered their first opponents of the campaign, ahead of the long road to next May’s final. Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City, already well off the blistering pace being set by Liverpool atop the Premier League table, will no doubt be keen to retain their FA Cup crown this time around, after cruising to victory in last season’s showpiece. As outlined above, though, this evening’s draw was highlighted by one fixture in particular, in the form of the Merseyside Derby. The tie marks the 2nd time in 3 years that Liverpool and Everton have been drawn against one another at this stage of the competition, with Jurgen Klopp’s Reds having emerged victorious last time out. The only other all-Premier League 3rd-round fixture sees Manchester United faced with the tough task of a trip to Wolves. Elsewhere, Arsenal are set to play host to Leeds, Man City get their defence underway at home to Port Vale, Chelsea welcome Nottingham Forest to Stamford Bridge, and Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham visit Middlesbrough.
