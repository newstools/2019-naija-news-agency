Abuja –Â The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday described President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s trip to London without allegedly transmitting power as required by the nationâ€™s constitution as an act of dereliction. The party said Buhariâ€™s private voyage out of the country without transmitting power confirmed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Buhari presidency were not interested in governance, but were seeking to vacate the constitutional order and foist an authoritarian system on the country. The PDP, in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said, â€œSuch dereliction of office can only come from leaders who do not have respect for the people they govern but are always muscling their way to power through intimidation, harassment, as well as official manipulations, as witnessed in the rigging of the February 23 presidential election by the APC. â€œMoreover, Mr. Presidentâ€™s abandoning of governance, particularly at this critical time when our nation is facing grave security and economic challenges, signposts the level of impunity and recklessness that will characterise our nation in the next four years, if the stolen presidential mandate is not retrieved from the APC.â€� Quoting a section of the constitution which President Buhari failed to obey, the party said: â€œWhat else, beside an authoritarian propensity, can explain why the Buhari presidency relegated our constitutional order by declaring the application of section 145 of the 1999 constitution (as amended) which directs that the president transmits power whenever he is travelling out of the country on vacation, as a mere â€˜conventionâ€™? â€œAuthoritarian tendencies are usually characterised by absolute lack of trust in other government functionaries, which could likely explain the failure to transmit power to the vice president. Such proclivity can also lead to a sequestering of institutions of government, if not checked.â€� The post Buhariâ€™s London Trip Without Transmitting Power Act Of Dereliction â€“ PDP appeared first on Independent Newspapers Nigeria.
