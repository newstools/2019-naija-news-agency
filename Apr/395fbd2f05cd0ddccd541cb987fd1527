 As workers celebrate May Day (Workers Day) on Wednesday 1st of May, the General Secretary, National Union of Textile, Garment Tailoring Workers, Union of Nigeria, Comrade Isa Aremu has lamented the inadequate number of the police serving millions of Nigerians. Aremu who observed this during the pre-May Day lecture in Kaduna on Tuesday, stated that any security chief that fails to ensure the protection of lives and the property at his jurisdiction should be sacked while any security chief that performed excellently should be promoted. While speaking on the treatment of workers, he said: â€œThe unity of Nigerian workers is inevitable in order to enshrine sanity into the system by ensuring social justice and fairness to all Nigerians irrespective of tribe, religion and region but a collective fight for the overall interest of all.â€� Comrade Aremu advised Nigerian workers to unite to bring an end to the crisis rocking northern Nigeria, stressing that all hands must be on deck to fight a common front towards resolving issues beyond religion, tribe and ensure the unity and progress of the country. According to him,â€œWorkers should learn to vote for their fellow workers that are seeking elective positions and politicians that have unquestionable characters in order to restore the countryâ€™s past glory where things will work for the general good of the people. The Secretary-General of the National Union of Textile, Garment, Tailoring Workers Union of Nigeria said “Leaders should be voted based on what they can do for the people not where they come from. “Our past leaders like Tafawa Barewa, a teacher was elected and Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto was an administrator, a civil servant was also elected into sensitive positions to lead the affairs of the country and they performed excellently.â€� He bemoaned the continuous crisis in Kaduna state saying, â€œIt is unacceptable for a state like Kaduna to be known with all manners of violence for years without any breakthrough. “The the workforce should ensure the situation is brought under control, there should be unity of purpose beyond religion and tribe to be able to forge ahead to ensure permanent peace in the state.â€� He called on Nigerian workers to unite in order to save themselves from the deteriorating situation in the country. Aremu added that labour should pick issues of national interest and engage government and also ensure that those issues are decisively addressed for the general good of the people.
